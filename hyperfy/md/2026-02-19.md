# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-02-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Shader Optimization for Lights**: Ash mentioned that developers have been using a technique of "priming shaders with a maximum number of lights" as a workaround, which is now officially supported. This appears to be related to a Twitter post about lights that was shared in the channel.

### Repository Management
- **Naming Conventions**: Jin considered naming options for a GitHub repository, debating between generic "apps" versus the more specific "hyperfy-apps". Jin ultimately decided that "hyperfy-apps" would be more discoverable when users are cloning repositories.

### Community Networking
- **EthDenver Event**: ChainPatrol (JL) mentioned having a booth (Booth N) at EthDenver and offered to set up a Telegram group to facilitate connections with the Hyperfy team.
- HypShaman inquired if another user was present in Denver, potentially related to the EthDenver event.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we have lights now?** (asked by Jin)  
**A**: Not directly answered, though Ash's subsequent comment about light implementation techniques suggests that lighting functionality may be available or improved with the shader optimization technique mentioned.

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Light Implementation Assistance**:
- **Helper**: Ash
- **Helpee**: Jin
- **Context**: Implementation of lights in shaders
- **Resolution**: Ash explained the technique of priming shaders with a maximum number of lights even when not all are being used, noting this approach is now officially supported.

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Implement shader priming technique**: Consider using the officially supported method of priming shaders with a maximum number of lights even when not all are being used. (Mentioned by Ash)

### Documentation
- **Repository naming conventions**: Consider documenting the preference for specific naming like "hyperfy-apps" instead of generic "apps" for better recognition when cloning repositories. (Mentioned by Jin)

### Community
- **EthDenver networking**: Follow up on ChainPatrol's offer to connect via Telegram for meetings at EthDenver. (Mentioned by JL from ChainPatrol)
