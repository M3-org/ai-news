# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-02-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyp File Management System
- **Jin** identified significant issues with the current approach of sharing binary .hyp files through Discord threads:
  - Problems with special characters in filenames
  - Discovery challenges for users
  - Security concerns with binary files
  - Inefficient organization and access
- **Ash** and **Jin** collaborated on potential solutions:
  - Creating a repository with a static site that evolves through PRs
  - Implementing an AI curator to process .hyp files without requiring technical knowledge
  - The AI could clean data, perform security scans, and generate previews
  - Potentially migrating the repository to the Hyperfy organization for better discovery
  - Possibly implementing as a Discord bot or bridged world
