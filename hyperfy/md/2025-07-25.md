# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Performance Optimization
- Developers discussed UI rendering performance in Valiant applications, particularly how redrawing UI elements impacts CPU/GPU usage
- Ashxn explained that UI is drawn optimally with batched changes, but complete redraws each frame cause performance issues
- Gh0sTt demonstrated this with an RGB keyboard effect that dropped FPS to 40
- Debate about whether browser tabs outside the world affect in-world performance stats, with mixed experiences reported
- Gh0sTt shared development philosophy: "1. make it work. 2. make it work for production. 3. make it optimized," which Ashxn endorsed as good practice

### App Ecosystem & Installation
- Users actively exploring and sharing Hyperfy v2 functionality, particularly focusing on apps (.hyp files)
- App installation works via drag-and-drop functionality into the browser
- Community-driven app sharing happening through #marketplace channel, playworld environment, and GitHub repositories
- Discussion about networked vs. local objects (networked changes visible to all users, local changes only visible to the user who made them)
- File size limitations discussed: 30MB models, 12MB persistent limit despite environment variable changes

### New Features
- Ashxn pushed a feature allowing visitors to equip custom avatars
- Emote wheel functionality highlighted as a significant feature, with plans to add it to the core "+" menu

### Market Activity
- Large token holder ("whale") named pizbik sold their entire position (approximately 800k worth)
- According to Xukonth, this seller liquidated all tokens in their wallet, not just Hyperfy
- Some community members viewed this as a buying opportunity, with Reneil noting the dip was "being eaten up fairly quickly"
