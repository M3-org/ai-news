# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-02-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### App Collection and Documentation
Jin shared a valuable resource containing extracted, cleaned, and summarized applications from the Hyperfy discord. This collection serves as a comprehensive repository of Hyperfy apps that users can test in Hyperfy v2 through a simple drag-and-drop process. The collection includes:
- Multiple applications with some duplicates
- Images from original posts where available
- AI-generated images (using nano banana pro) for apps missing media
- Accessible interface at https://madjin.github.io/hyperfy-apps/

This initiative appears to be part of an effort to organize and preserve community-created applications while making them more accessible to users.
