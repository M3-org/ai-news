      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on improving the system for sharing and managing .hyp files. Jin highlighted issues with the current approach of sharing binary files through Discord threads, noting problems with special characters in filenames, discovery challenges, and security concerns. Jin suggested implementing a better system for analyzing and indexing .hyp files, possibly drawing inspiration from the avatar rating system in v1. Ash proposed creating a repository with a static site that could evolve through PRs, potentially guarded by an AI that could process .hyp files without requiring technical knowledge from users. Jin expanded on this idea, suggesting an AI curator could clean data, perform security scans, and generate previews. They also proposed migrating the repository to the Hyperfy organization for better discovery and possibly implementing the solution as a Discord bot or bridged world.\n\n## 2.
