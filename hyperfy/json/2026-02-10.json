      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about hosting VRM files for avatars. Roustan explains that they use Arweave (app.ardrive.io) for decentralized hosting of avatar files, mentioning it costs approximately $0.10-$0.50 per avatar depending on file size. They also reference creating a tutorial for hosting on Google APIs (Web2) for users who don't fully understand decentralization. Additionally, there's a brief discussion about intellectual property rights related to RTFKT clones, with Roustan clarifying that modified clones can be sold as long as they don't contain Nike or RTFKT logos and are properly labeled with the clone number.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you arrange the VRM file share in practice? Does it cost you money? (asked by Fibelius) A: I use Arweave https://app.ardrive.io I put down $10 and each avatar probably costs me like .10 - .50 cents depending on file size.
