      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is brief and contains minimal technical discussion. There's a mention of a Twitter post about lights, which prompted a brief technical comment from ash about shader optimization for lights. The discussion notes that developers have been \"priming shaders with a maximum number of lights\" as a workaround, and this approach is now officially supported. There's also a short exchange where jin considers naming conventions for a GitHub repository, initially suggesting \"apps\" versus \"hyperfy-apps\", but ultimately decides that \"hyperfy-apps\" might be more discoverable when cloning.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we have lights now? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered directly, though ash later commented on light implementation techniques.\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: jin | Context: Implementation of lights in shaders | Resolution: Explained that developers have been priming shaders with a maximum number of lights even when not used, and this approach is now officially supported.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Consider implementing the officially supported shader priming technique for handling multiple lights | Description: Using maximum number of lights in shaders even when not all are being used | Mentioned By: ash\nDocumentation: Consider documenting repository naming conventions for better discoverability | Description: Using \"hyperfy-apps\" instead of generic \"apps\" for better recognition when cloning | Mentioned By: jin",

JL from ChainPatrol inquires if the team will be attending EthDenver, mentioning that ChainPatrol has a booth (Booth N) and offering to set up a Telegram group to facilitate connections. A few hours later, hypShaman asks another user if they are in Denver. No technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations are present in this limited exchange.",
