Jin shares concerns about Arweave following an incident referenced in a Twitter post, suggesting that while Arweave works, the incident \"raised eyebrows.\" The conversation explores alternatives for file hosting, including Cloudflare R2 storage as a centralized but reliable option offering 10GB free storage with 10 million downloads monthly. Participants emphasize the importance of \"local first\" approaches to file storage as the most reliable guarantee. Ash suggests that torrents are underutilized and could benefit from UX improvements, better branding, and incentive mechanisms like tokens to reward good seeders. The overall theme is exploring reliable file hosting solutions with varying degrees of decentralization.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What alternatives exist to Arweave for file hosting?
