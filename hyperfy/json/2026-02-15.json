The collection includes some duplicate apps. Jin used images shared within the same post (or adjacent posts) for each app and utilized nano banana pro to generate images where media was missing. Users can test these apps by dragging and dropping them into Hyperfy v2. Jin provided a link (https://madjin.github.io/hyperfy-apps/) for accessing the collection and requested users to report issues and provide feedback.\n\n## 2.
