# ElizaOS Development Updates - January 7, 2026

## Technical Issues and Fixes

### Discord Plugin Bootstrap Issues
- Multiple users experienced problems with Discord plugin version 1.7.0, particularly server ID detection errors with the bootstrap plugin
- Odilitime identified the issue as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId`
- Created fix branch (odi-17) with corrections for bootstrap's actions/providers
- Submitted PR (#6333) to address these issues

### ElizaOS Cloud API Integration
- Resolved "Model not found" errors for cloud agents built into websites
- Implemented proper model parameter formatting with provider prefixes:
  - `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
  - `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
  - `google/gemini-2.5-flash`

## Development Resources and Architecture

### GitHub Agentic Workflows
- Jin shared GitHub Next's agentics repository documentation update workflow as reference material

### Unified Messaging API Updates
- Stan submitted pull requests for Telegram and Discord plugins
- Implemented unified messaging API with ElizaOS support
- Refactored to use `handleMessage` instead of deprecated `sendMessage` method

### Hybrid Architecture RFC
- Stan published RFC-001 exploring hybrid architecture with persistent workers
- Document available for team review on HackMD

### Discord Gateway Implementation
- Odilitime recommended reviewing Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's Discord bridge implementation
- Architecture includes individual event pumps for different services with scaling considerations

## Community and Token Discussions

### Contract Address Visibility
- Shaw confirmed work on making the ElizaOS contract address (CA) more accessible
- Team refreshing linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier token information access

### Token Migration
- Clarified ai16z to ElizaOS token migration eligibility: only tokens held at snapshot time (November 11) qualify for 1:6 ratio migration

### Development Tools
- Odilitime shared finding from Cursor call: users inputting their own Claude API key don't receive Cursor-optimized version with output improvements

## Ongoing Work Updates

### Stan's Current Work
