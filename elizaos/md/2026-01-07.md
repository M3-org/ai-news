# ElizaOS Development Report - January 7, 2026

## Discord Plugin Bootstrap Fixes

Critical fixes were implemented for bootstrap's actions/providers to address issues in version 1.7.0. The main problem involved serverId vs messageServerId migration causing "No server ID found" errors when running Discord bots. A fix was submitted via PR #6333 and tested with discord plugin version 1.3.3.

## Contract Address Visibility Improvements

The team committed to improving CA visibility on X/Twitter accounts. Solutions implemented included:
- Pinned tweets on the Eliza account
- Updated Linktree to point to CoinGecko
- Made CAs findable within 10 seconds on website/Twitter

## ElizaOS Cloud API Integration

Proper model parameter formatting was established with provider prefixes:
- openai/gpt-4o-mini
- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
- google/gemini-2.5-flash

This formatting is now recommended when calling agent API endpoints from external websites.

## Unified Messaging API Updates

Pull requests were submitted for both Telegram and Discord plugins implementing unified messaging API with ElizaOS support:
- Refactored to use handleMessage instead of deprecated sendMessage
- Updated UnifiedMessagingAPI interface
- Fixed API calls in messages.ts

**Completed PRs:**
