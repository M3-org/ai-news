# ElizaOS Development Report - January 6, 2026

## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes

A Discord plugin compatibility issue was identified and resolved between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. The error "No server ID found 10" was traced to a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase.

- Odilitime created fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues
- PR #6333 submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility
- Users experiencing issues directed to either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5

## New Contributor Onboarding

A blockchain and AI engineer (aicodeflow.dev) joined the community and was onboarded to contribute to ElizaOS.

- Odilitime directed new contributor to github.com/elizaos-plugins/ for available plugins
- Lead developer of Spartan project offered collaboration on DeFi utilities
- K_carv mentioned upcoming open sessions for contributors

## Database Migration Issues

The team provided solutions for destructive migration errors occurring when running `elizaos start` a second time.

- Solution provided: set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` environment variable
- Recommended using `elizaos dev` for continuous development monitoring to avoid repeatedly triggering migration checks

## Token Migration and Contract Address Visibility

Shaw committed to posting contract addresses more prominently following community feedback.

- K_carv noted linktree would be refreshed to point to CoinGecko
- Clarified that only users who held tokens at the November 11 snapshot are eligible to migrate
