# ElizaOS Development Report - January 6, 2026

## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes

A Discord plugin compatibility issue was identified and resolved between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. The error "No server ID found 10" was traced to a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase.

- Odilitime created fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues
- PR #6333 submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility
- Users experiencing issues can use version 1.6.5 as a temporary solution

## New Contributor Onboarding

A blockchain and AI engineer joined the community and was directed to contribution opportunities:

- Recommended to explore github.com/elizaos-plugins/ for plugin development
- Directed to the Spartan project (https://github.com/elizaos/spartan) focusing on DeFi utilities and quantitative trading features
- Connected with team for upcoming open sessions

## Database Migration Solution

A solution was provided for destructive migration errors when running `elizaos start`:

- Set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development
- Use `elizaos dev` command for continuous monitoring during development

The team acknowledged community feedback regarding contract address visibility:

- Shaw committed to addressing CA visibility issues
- Linktree being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for easier token information access
