## Core Development Activities

- Core development team worked on fixing CI issues with a pull request addressing bootstrap cache memory leaks and test failures
- A bug was reported regarding Babylon's share to Farcaster link displaying incorrectly
- Team shared reverse-engineered Claude Code binary that revealed a hidden SDK URL flag, enabling WebSocket client functionality accessible from browsers and mobile devices
- Team shared agent-tail, a new dev tool that makes logs accessible to agents by wrapping dev server commands and installing skills to provide full context of browser, server, and other logs

## Developer Collaboration and Recruitment

- Multiple developers posted in the coders channel seeking opportunities and collaboration
- One developer shared expertise in full-stack and AI development including React, Next.js, Python, LangChain, RAG, and AI Agents

- Discussion covered OpenClaw, an assistant that can take over computers and run system-level commands, with both consumer and highly technical versions in development
- Users can select themes, avatars, and voice options for customization

## Community Proposals

- Community members proposed implementing optional weekly or topical updates inside ElizaCloud.ai account dashboards to improve customer retention, transparency, and expectation management
- Proposed format would focus on presenting relevant information about project progress, bug fixes, objectives, and timings in simple text suitable for newbies and non-coders
- Suggestion made to create an AI communications agent to automate customer service and updates across Discord, Twitter, GitHub, and user accounts, which could potentially be sold as a white-label B2B solution
