# ElizaOS Daily Report - February 20, 2026

## Project Status and Community Discussions

### Token and Project Direction

Community members engaged in extensive discussions about the ElizaOS token and project direction. Key concerns were raised about the token's performance following the migration from ai16z to elizaOS, with users noting the loss of the original memetic branding around a VC fund led by KOL clones. The tribute model where new agents gave 5-10% to the DAO was discontinued after receiving tokens that couldn't be effectively traded or utilized.

DorianD identified three major weaknesses:
- Lack of live agents on social media enabling meaningful stack interaction
- Communication failures resulting in negative sentiment from influential groups
- Insufficient investor excitement due to unclear token utility

The team acknowledged these challenges, with Odilitime stating that recovery will take time. There was consensus that 2026 is a building year. Users noted that recovery depends on ElizaCloud gaining users and the Jeju network becoming operational.

### Platform Updates

- Babylon is now open to the top 5000 on the waitlist
- Shaw posts AI and dev content on Twitter while crypto content goes on Farcaster
- The team continues pushing out promised products

## Technical Issues Reported

### ElizaCloud Platform

DorianD identified several technical issues:
- Scrolling problems on the API explorer page where mousepad scrolling was broken
- API testing functionality showed errors stating "api key is required for this endpoint" when attempting to send test requests

- Questions raised about the "use a different key" option for bringing your own keys from providers

Odilitime confirmed receiving the bug reports and forwarded them to the development team.
