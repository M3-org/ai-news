There was one significant technical interaction where user DorianD provided guidance to 3on_ about creating an agent, specifically using Cursor AI and integrating ElizaOS documentation repositories. DorianD explained the process of forking the main repo, cloning it locally, and configuring settings to index files for better agent functionality. There were also brief mentions of market analysis tools and questions about the project's direction, with some users expressing concern about the project focusing on memecoins rather than developing trading agents with product-market fit.
