DorianD provided guidance on installing and configuring agents using Cursor AI, including forking repositories, cloning locally, and indexing files.

Key technical topics included embedding configuration for plugin-knowledge, integration with plugin-ollama, and compatibility issues with various plugins. Users discussed optimal embedding models, with 0xbbjoker recommending OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model with 3072 dimensions. There were specific issues with the Twitter plugin's check interval, the browser search plugin's Playwright dependency, and the knowledge plugin's document recognition. The chat also touched on Eliza's response formatting capabilities, particularly JSON formatting problems with OpenAI models, and transaction failures in a launchpad application. A clarification was provided that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is Eliza a single response model by default? (asked by Snapper) A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)\nQ: How can I change the Twitter plugin check interval?
