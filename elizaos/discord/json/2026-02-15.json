      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat segment contains limited technical discussion, primarily focused on strategic considerations around ElizaOS ecosystem growth. DorianD proposed that the base ElizaOS installation strategy aims to increase node installations to facilitate easier integration when token utility is implemented. A key technical suggestion emerged regarding system prompting enhancements: DorianD recommended that the base install should include system prompts making agents aware of ElizaCloud capabilities and suggesting them as solution sets for both ElizaOS and the Milaidy fork. This would improve discoverability and integration of cloud features.\n\n0xConsole briefly mentioned that an Openclaw adapter implementation was completed quickly, indicating successful integration work, though no technical details were provided. The conversation also included off-topic exchanges about job seeking and market conditions that weren't technically relevant.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the milaidy thing? Does that tie back to $elizaos? (asked by g) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is there anyone looking for developer? (asked by C.C) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around several critical issues affecting the ElizaOS community. The primary concern was the **migration deadline from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens**, which ended on February 4th after a 90-day window. Multiple users (fibsonly, Andi CEGY, GomesCozendey) expressed frustration about missing the migration deadline, with some holders losing access to their tokens despite holding since before the November 11 snapshot. Omid Sa confirmed that no further migration support is available after the official deadline.\n\n**Security concerns** were prominent, with Monsgroow reporting scammer ID 364718078946312192 operating through the coders thread. Multiple users encountered scam attempts, particularly fragmtagmbagm who was targeted through a fake support ticket in the coders thread. Odilitime warned that legitimate support never asks users to join other Discord servers or Zoom calls.\n\n**Technical discussions** included questions about staking availability (expected after JEJU launch) and deployment issues with Spartan agent (Einav Livne seeking help from Odilitime). The community discussed the **tokenomics challenge**: DannyNOR NoFapArc highlighted that the ElizaOS framework has no direct tie to the token, creating zero inherent reason to buy it, which remains a major hurdle. Alexei mentioned potential buyback mechanisms using revenue from Eliza Cloud.\n\n**Market sentiment** showed concern over the $12 million market cap (Kvízákov questioning why meme coins have higher valuations). DorianD noted the loss of memetic power from moving away from the ai16z branding. 0xqueen shared Shaw's post about ElizaOS capabilities and offered to share seedance2.0 account access for creating promotional videos.\n\n## 2.

(asked by Omid Sa) A: Directed to admin but not resolved in chat\n\nQ: Is there anyone here that can help me deploy spartan agent? (asked by Einav Livne) A: Yes, Odilitime offered assistance (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is there really no way for long-term holders to migrate? (asked by Andi CEGY) A: Migration period is ended, unfortunately nothing can be done (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How can I open a ticket about the migration? (asked by GomesCozendey) A: Cannot open tickets; official support channel closed February 4th (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How did openclaw steal the spotlight a year after yall built this?
