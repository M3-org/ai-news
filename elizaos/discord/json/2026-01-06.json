      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several key technical areas within the ElizaOS ecosystem:\n\n**Discord Plugin Issues (Primary Technical Focus):**\nDigitalDiva encountered critical bugs with the Discord plugin in ElizaOS v1.7.0. The bot couldn't detect server ID, username, or server owner despite correct intents and admin permissions. Error logs showed \"No server ID found\" and bootstrap plugin issues. Odilitime identified the root cause as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase. He recommended either downgrading to v1.6.5 or using a custom branch (odi-17) with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers. Shaw suggested debugging with a minimal hello world script using discord.js to isolate permission issues in the Discord developer portal.\n\n**ElizaOS Development & Contributions:**\naicodeflow, a blockchain + AI engineer, expressed interest in contributing to ElizaOS, specifically around agent autonomy with constraints, onchain execution layers with guardrails, prediction market templates, and observability tooling. Odilitime directed them to the Spartan project (github.com/elizaos/spartan), which focuses on DeFi utilities. The recommended approach was to explore the plugin-based architecture at github.com/elizaos-plugins/ and start contributing to existing plugins.\n\n**DegenAI Status:**\nmeltingsnow inquired about DegenAI updates. satsbased confirmed the new version hasn't shipped yet. BingBongBing noted significant GitHub activity on ElizaOS and mentioned upcoming DegenAI developments at 1M market cap.\n\n**Token & Migration Questions:**\nMultiple users (Emma, nancy) asked about AI16Z to ElizaOS migration mechanics and multipliers. Omid Sa clarified that purchases after the November 11 snapshot aren't eligible for migration.\n\n**Marketing & Visibility:**\ndegenwtf raised concerns about ElizaOS contract address visibility on official X accounts. Kenk and Broccolex debated best practices, with plans to update Linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier CA discovery.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What changes have been made with DegenAI? (asked by meltingsnow) A: The new version hasn't shipped yet (answered by satsbased)\n\nQ: What are earning agents? (asked by Connor On-Chain) A: Agents that make you money (answered by satsbased)\n\nQ: Why does the Discord plugin show \"No server ID found\" errors? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: This is because ElizaOS is moving from serverId to messageServerId; the issue exists in v1.7.0 (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What version should I use to avoid Discord plugin issues? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Use v1.6.5 or the odi-17 branch with bootstrap fixes (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts? (asked by degenwtf) A: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: If I buy AI16Z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X? (asked by nancy) A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Can you find projects in top 50 with CA in their X bio? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in built by ElizaOS? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\nQ: When are you planning on implementing application building? (asked by Connor On-Chain) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How can I help with ElizaOS development? (asked by aicodeflow) A: Start by reading code in github.com/elizaos-plugins/, find a plugin to work on, or contribute to Spartan project (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on several key technical issues and contributions. **jin** shared RSS feed URLs for ElizaOS documentation and suggested creating a combined dashboard with multiple data sources.\n\n**DigitalDiva** encountered a persistent Discord integration error (\"No server ID found 10\") despite having correct permissions and intents. The error originated from the message processing service where `room.serverId` was undefined, causing the agent to fail when handling Discord messages.\n\n**AlleyBoss** announced an updated library for x402 protocol integration with ElizaOS (`@alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`), offering a simplified implementation approach.\n\n**aicodeflow** introduced themselves as a blockchain/AI engineer and offered expertise in three areas: cleaning up embedding delegation, redesigning plugins as \"skills\" rather than integrations, and building market-aware agents focused on interpretation/state rather than execution. They emphasized experience with model-agnostic agent setups to avoid hidden dependencies in Anthropic/OpenAI configurations.\n\n**Andrei Mitrea** faced a database migration error when running `elizaos start` a second time. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like \"agent_id\" and \"room_id\" from the worlds table. **! \"Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇\"** provided the solution: set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development, noting this is safe for dev but requires careful review in production.\n\n**Omid Sa** recommended using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.\n\n**ElizaBAO** encountered a \"Model not found\" error when integrating ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. **cjft** resolved this by explaining the correct model parameter format requires provider prefixes (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`).\n\n**jin** also shared a GitHub workflow reference for documentation updates from GitHub Next's agentics repository.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I fix the \"No server ID found 10\" error in Discord integration? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I run elizaos start without getting destructive migration errors? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting: `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start`. This is safe for local development but review migrations carefully for production. (answered by ! \"Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇\")\n\nQ: Is the GitHub repo up to date for automated X account setup? (asked by selombre) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I fix \"Model not found\" error when building ElizaOS cloud agents into a website? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Use provider prefix format for the model parameter: openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: How can I continuously monitor code changes on the agent? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Use `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical areas for elizaOS development:\n\n**ElizaOS Bug Fixes and Releases**: Odilitime identified a critical fix in version 1.7.0 (PR #6333) and recommended rushing out a release. However, the fix didn't work with Discord 1.3.3, requiring testing across various Discord branches and a new Discord release.\n\n**Cloud Infrastructure Optimization**: Stan identified multiple ways to improve latency on the monorepo and planned to push several PRs. He's working on cloud fixes to handle TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" approach combined with deslop. Additionally, he's optimizing runtime initialization.\n\n**Discord Gateway Architecture**: Discussion emerged around Shaw's preferred implementation of the Discord bridge in the Jeju cloud branch. The team discussed whether problematic connectors need individual gateways. Odilitime suggested using simple event pumps with multiple daemon instances per service for scale. He emphasized that voice connections will need higher priority/bandwidth event pumps than text, and preprocessing will be valuable.\n\n**Plugin Development**: Stan submitted PRs for Telegram (#22) and Discord (#41) plugins, seeking review.\n\n**Cursor API Limitation**: Odilitime discovered that using your own Claude API key in Cursor means you don't get the cursor-optimized version of Claude where they implement tricks to improve output.\n\n**Content Correction**: The team identified an incorrect fact about Eigenlayer that appeared on their website and is now being propagated by LLMs, deciding not to repeat it in future content.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes (answered by jin, shared https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book)\n\nQ: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Direction is simple event pumps, likely need more than one daemon instance per service for scale, with voice connections needing higher priority/bandwidth than text (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.
