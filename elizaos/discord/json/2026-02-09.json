The conversation touches on three main topics:\n\n**Regime Change Discussion**: Krippトメア acknowledges a previous story about regime and world-order change use cases, noting these represent a \"different beast\" in terms of complexity or implementation challenges.\n\n**Marketing and Organic Growth**: DorianD shares a LinkedIn post about OpenClaw/MoltBot AI, emphasizing the need for \"organic\" promotional content. This suggests a focus on authentic community-driven marketing rather than forced promotional efforts. DorianD also mentions billionaires having houses in New Zealand, though the context connecting this to the technical discussion is unclear.\n\n**Eliza Attention Generation**: Broccolex shares a Twitter/X post from @joemccann, suggesting it could generate attention for Eliza (likely referring to an AI project or framework). This indicates ongoing efforts to increase visibility and adoption.\n\n**Additional Link**: Kenk shares a Twitter/X post from @owocki without additional context.\n\nThe segment lacks substantive technical implementation details, code discussions, or problem-solving activities. It appears to be a partners channel focused on strategic positioning and visibility rather than hands-on development work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nNo meaningful technical questions with responses were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nNo direct help interactions were identified in this chat segment.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on several technical issues with ElizaOS/milaidy installations and plugin development. The most significant technical exchange involved **azsxdc** encountering multiple errors on a fresh VPS installation of milaidy, including a crash in the \"agent_skill_instructions\" provider where `skill.description.toLowerCase is not a function`. **Odilitime** confirmed this is a known bug requiring a fix. Two other errors were clarified as normal and ignorable: missing server ID for world and server ownership issues. A third warning about pluginRegistryService failing with 401 Unauthorized was identified as work-in-progress functionality.\n\n**kira** inquired about wallet management plugins for openclaw, specifically for game skill integration with security considerations, but received no response. **Vega** announced development of a plugin to use SillyTavern character cards, promising to release it later. **Wes** questioned the need for Cardano wallet integration in ElizaOS. **DorianD** asked about submission to clawhub without context. **ElizaBAO** promoted their Colosseum Agent Hackathon project combining ElizaBAO + Claw with Polymarket signal scanning, x402/SOL paywall, and Moltbook autoposters. **s** mentioned existing WebSocket functionality via plugin/server.\n\nThe channel also contained spam/scam content that moderators acknowledged needing better autoban systems for.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the best wallet management plugin for openclaw? (asked by kira) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are these errors normal on a fresh install on VPS for milaidy?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion channel was dominated by community concerns about token price decline, exchange delistings, and perceived lack of team communication. The primary technical issue discussed was the Korean exchange delisting situation - there was significant confusion about whether ELIZAOS was being delisted from Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. User gby claimed the delisting was confirmed and scheduled, while davidhq and paolin later clarified that only the pre-rebrand AI16Z token was delisted, not the current ELIZAOS token.\n\nA critical migration issue emerged when user ufw discovered they had missed the ai16z to ELIZA token migration deadline, asking if their tokens were lost. This question went unanswered by team members.\n\nTechnical development updates were minimal but included: jin posting a weekly roundup video of ElizaOS updates, yojo providing feedback on elizacloud.ai UX optimization needs (suggesting prompt-only user features, visual generation optimization, plug-in marketplace, and crypto transfers without wallet connect), and Seppmos sharing a video covering Babylon and Hyperscape developments.\n\nCommunity sentiment was largely negative, with multiple users (averma, gby, Gem Hunter) expressing concerns about: lack of token utility, team selling tokens (specifically Shaw's wallet DScqtGwFoDTme2Rzdjpdb2w7CtuKc6Z8KF7hMhbx8ugQ being monitored), developers leaving the project (CJ and another unnamed dev), and absence of admin/team presence in the channel. User ovo defended the team, noting Shaw covered unexpected costs to recover the X account and that the team burned 22M tokens. The discussion revealed deep frustration from token holders who felt the open-source development work wasn't translating to token value or holder benefits.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where can I bridge eliza token from solana to bsc? (asked by clutch) A: There is currently NO official or safe bridge for Eliza from Solana to BSC (answered by EMERSON3S)\n\nQ: Is $ELIZAOS going to be delisted from the 3 korean exchanges? (asked by avi_rajput563 | TABI 💢) A: Conflicting responses - gby claimed delisting was confirmed and scheduled in 2 hours on Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit; davidhq and paolin later clarified only pre-rebrand AI16Z was delisted, not current ELIZAOS (answered by EMERSON3S initially saying \"ignore the lies\", then gby, davidhq, and paolin)\n\nQ: What happens if I didn't migrate my original a16z tokens in time? (asked by ufw) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the support desk discord thing a scam? (asked by ufw) A: Yes it is (answered by Monsgroow.)\n\nQ: What is the CA of this new Elizacoin? (asked by Convex Bit) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is Shaw selling his elizaos tokens? (asked by gby) A: gby provided wallet address DScqtGwFoDTme2Rzdjpdb2w7CtuKc6Z8KF7hMhbx8ugQ claiming Shaw was selling; ovo and davidhq disputed this, asking for transaction IDs as proof (answered by ovo and davidhq)\n\nQ: Why was this rugged? (asked by thorionpartners) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Where can we read about updates? (asked by Rainman) A: jin mentioned weekly roundup videos are posted, likely to a specific channel (answered by jin)\n\n## 3.
