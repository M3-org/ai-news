      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the ElizaOS project, which appears to be an AI agent platform on Solana. A significant ongoing issue is that ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z have been banned from X (formerly Twitter), which has been a point of concern for community members. Kenk, who seems to be part of the ElizaOS team, mentioned they have \"a resolution with X in sight\" and are holding off on creating new accounts. The team is not sharing screenshots of communications with X but indicated that communication between teams has become quicker. There's also discussion about the Solana ecosystem's relative silence regarding ElizaOS's situation, with Kenk noting that while Solana has featured them in hackathons, the broader ecosystem support has been limited, though Superteam has supported them at builder events and incubators. Kenk clarified that while ElizaOS is Solana-native from a token perspective, they are chain-agnostic. The chat also includes sharing of team member X accounts for community members to follow for updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news and updates about ElizaOS? (asked by Hannes K.) A: Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For the time being, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us? (asked by Gianni) A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical, ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses technical aspects of Eliza, focusing on response models and formatting issues. Snapper inquired about Eliza's default behavior as a single response model and whether custom orchestration is needed for multiple responses. Shaw clarified that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence and supports websockets for non-response messaging. Samuel Chauche reported problems with Eliza's JSON response format, noting hallucinations and incorrect handling of single quotes that affect data display in their extension. ElizaBAO shared a technical issue with a transaction failure in a launchpad application, mentioning deserialization errors. Starlord suggested using a larger model to address hallucination issues, assuming local model usage, but Samuel clarified they were using OpenAI and regularly cleaning the elizadb folder.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default? We need to build custom orchestration patterns if we want the agent to deliver multiple responses? (asked by Snapper) A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message *not* as a response (answered by shaw)\nQ: How can we fix Eliza's JSON response format hallucinations? (asked by Samuel Chauche) A: Try a larger model. And if you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI (answered by starlord)\n\n## 3.
