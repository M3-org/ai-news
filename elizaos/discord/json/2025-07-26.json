      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the ElizaOS project, which appears to be an AI agent platform on Solana. A significant ongoing issue is that ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z have been banned from X (formerly Twitter), which has been a point of concern for community members. Kenk, who seems to be part of the ElizaOS team, mentioned they have \"a resolution with X in sight\" and are holding off on creating new accounts. The team is not sharing screenshots of communications with X but indicated that communication between teams has become quicker. There was also discussion about the Solana ecosystem's relative silence regarding ElizaOS's situation, with Kenk acknowledging this observation while noting that Solana has featured them in hackathons and that Superteam has supported them at builder events and incubators. Kenk also mentioned that while ElizaOS is Solana-native from a token perspective, they are chain-agnostic. When asked about potential catalysts for the ElizaOS ecosystem, Kenk indicated that opportunities for agents on-chain are broad and diverse, with different catalysts across verticals ranging from IP to Content Creators.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news and updates about ElizaOS? (asked by Hannes K.) A: Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For the time being, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us? (asked by Gianni) A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: Hannes K. | Context: New community member asking which X accounts to follow for ElizaOS updates | Resolution: Kenk provided a comprehensive list of team members to follow and explained they're holding off on creating new accounts pending X resolution.\nHelper: Quaser M | Helpee: shifuzen | Context: shifuzen requested a link | Resolution: Quaser M sent the link via private message as it would be auto-deleted in the channel.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses Eliza's capabilities and limitations. Key technical points include:\n\n- Clarification that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses\n- Websockets functionality allowing messages to be sent outside the standard response pattern\n- A technical issue with Eliza's JSON response format where she's hallucinating and modifying single quotes, causing display problems in an extension\n- A transaction failure error related to \"instruction deserialization\" in the auto.fun launchpad\n- A suggestion that hallucination issues with local models might be resolved by using larger models, cloud GPUs, or OpenAI services\n\nThe conversation highlights challenges in ensuring consistent output formatting from AI models and debugging blockchain transaction errors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default? (asked by Snapper) A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)\nQ: How can we fix Eliza's response format when she's hallucinating and not respecting our specific JSON format? (asked by Samuel Chauche) A: Try a larger model. If you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI. (answered by starlord)\nQ: How to solve \"Transaction failed due to instruction deserialization error\" in the auto.fun launchpad? (asked by ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: Snapper | Context: Misunderstanding about Eliza's response capabilities | Resolution: Clarified that Eliza can plan multiple actions and use websockets to send messages outside standard responses\nHelper: starlord | Helpee: Samuel Chauche | Context: Eliza hallucinating JSON format and modifying quotes | Resolution: Suggested using a larger model, cloud GPU, or OpenAI (though Samuel clarified he was already using OpenAI)\n\n## 4.
