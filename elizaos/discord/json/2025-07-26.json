      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"discussion\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the ElizaOS project, which appears to be an AI agent platform on Solana. A significant ongoing issue is that ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z have been banned from X (formerly Twitter), which has been a point of concern for community members. Team member Kenk confirmed they're working toward a resolution with X and communications between teams have improved. The team is holding off on creating new accounts as they expect a resolution soon. There was also discussion about the Solana ecosystem's relative silence regarding ElizaOS's situation, with Kenk noting that while Superteam has supported them at builder events, broader ecosystem support has been limited. Kenk shared links to team members' X accounts for community members to follow for updates. The project appears to be chain-agnostic from a technical perspective but Solana-native from a token perspective.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which X accounts should I follow for ElizaOS updates? (asked by Hannes K.) A: Follow the team members' accounts as listed, as they're holding off on creating new accounts while resolving issues with X. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us? (asked by Gianni) A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical, ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses Eliza's capabilities and limitations. Key technical points include:\n\n- Clarification that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses\n- Websocket functionality allows sending messages outside the standard response pattern\n- A user is experiencing issues with Eliza's JSON response format, with the model hallucinating and modifying single quotes\n- Another user is encountering a transaction failure due to instruction deserialization errors in a launchpad application\n- A recommendation to use larger models to reduce hallucinations when running locally, though the user clarified they're using OpenAI and regularly cleaning the elizadb folder\n\nThe discussion highlights challenges in ensuring consistent output formats from AI models and debugging transaction failures in blockchain applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default? (asked by Snapper) A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)\nQ: How can we fix Eliza hallucinating and not respecting our required JSON format? (asked by Samuel Chauche) A: Try a larger model. If you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI. (answered by starlord)\nQ: How to solve \"Transaction failed due to instruction deserialization error\" in auto.fun launchpad? (asked by ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: Snapper | Context: Understanding Eliza's response capabilities | Resolution: Clarified that Eliza can plan multiple actions and use websockets for non-response messages\nHelper: starlord | Helpee: Samuel Chauche | Context: Eliza hallucinating JSON format responses | Resolution: Suggested using larger models, though user clarified they were already using OpenAI\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Investigate and fix JSON format hallucination issues with Eliza responses | Description: Resolve single quotes replacement/movement in JSON outputs | Mentioned By: Samuel Chauche\nTechnical: Debug transaction failure in auto.fun launchpad | Description: Fix \"Transaction failed due to instruction deserialization error\" | Mentioned By: ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ\nDocumentation: Document Eliza's multi-action capabilities | Description: Clarify that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence | Mentioned By: shaw",
