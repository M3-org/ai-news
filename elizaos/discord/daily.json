      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on DigitalDiva's Discord bot integration issues with ElizaOS version 1.7.0. The bot was failing to recognize server IDs, throwing \"No server ID found 10\" errors related to the bootstrap plugin. The error logs showed issues with the transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase.\n\nOdilitime diagnosed the problem as stemming from incomplete fixes in the 1.7.0 core release. He recommended either downgrading to version 1.6.5 or waiting for fixes. Shaw suggested debugging by creating a minimal Discord.js hello world script to isolate whether the issue was permission-related in the Discord developer portal versus code-related.\n\nOdilitime actively worked on resolving the issue, creating a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with corrections for bootstrap's actions and providers that should work with plugin-discord 1.3.3. The solution involved addressing compatibility issues between the latest core version and the Discord plugin.\n\nSecondary discussions included requests for better visibility of the ElizaOS contract address (CA) across official channels. Community members noted difficulty finding the correct CA, with suggestions for pinned tweets or website improvements. Kenk mentioned the linktree was being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the agent need admin privileges? (asked by Odilitime) A: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: What version of ElizaOS are you using? (asked by Odilitime) A: Version 1.7.0 with plugin-discord 1.3.3 (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Should I use version 1.6.5 instead? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Yes, might be easier to use older core like 1.6.5, or use the odi-17 branch with fixes (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts? (asked by degenwtf) A: The team will get on it, linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko (answered by shaw and Kenk)\n\nQ: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X? (asked by nancy) A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in related to ElizaOS? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion focused on two main technical topics. First, jin shared a GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation for updating docs, noting it contained valuable information. \n\nThe primary technical issue involved ElizaBAO encountering a \"Model not found\" error when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints. The problem was resolved by cjft, who provided specific guidance on proper model parameter formatting for API endpoint calls. The solution required using provider-prefixed model names in one of three recommended formats: openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash. This formatting convention ensures the API correctly identifies and routes requests to the appropriate AI model provider.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Use provider prefix formats like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical bug fixes and architectural decisions for ElizaOS. Odilitime identified a significant issue in version 1.7.0 requiring an urgent release (PR #6333), though compatibility problems persisted with Discord 1.3.3, necessitating testing across multiple Discord branches and a new Discord release.\n\nStan submitted two plugin PRs for Telegram (#22) and Discord (#41) and shared documentation for review on HackMD. He provided a standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, plus runtime initialization optimizations with corresponding Linear tickets created.\n\nA key architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways. Odilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation. The conversation evolved into scaling considerations, with Odilitime proposing simple event pumps as the direction forward. He emphasized the need for multiple daemon instances per service and differentiated requirements between voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority event pumps) and text connections. Preprocessing was identified as a valuable optimization strategy.\n\nJin shared the ElizaOS book documentation on HackMD, confirming the existence of a team workspace.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes (answered by jin, sharing https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book)\n\nQ: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Stan ⚡ | Context: Stan working on Discord connector implementation | Resolution: Recommended reviewing Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway\n\nHelper: jin | Helpee: Stan ⚡ | Context: Stan asking about HackMD team workspace availability | Resolution: Confirmed existence and shared link to ElizaOS book workspace\n\n## 4.
