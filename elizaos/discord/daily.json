Summary\n\nThis is a very brief chat segment where Stan shares a HackMD MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration tool from GitHub (https://github.com/yuna0x0/hackmd-mcp). Stan proposes that the team adopt this tool for collaborative note-taking and documentation purposes. The primary motivation is to facilitate easier sharing and collaborative editing of notes among team members while eliminating the need for copy-pasting content. Stan mentions they will personally use the tool and recommends team-wide adoption. The segment contains no technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementation details beyond the basic tool recommendation. No other team members responded in this segment, so there are no decisions made or questions answered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nNo meaningful questions or answers were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 3.
