The single message is a personal historical anecdote from DorianD about their great grandfather's experience with currency devaluation during migration from the Russian empire to Poland. The story describes how hyperinflation reduced the value of money from selling a house to only being able to purchase a sofa during a one-month journey to Krakow, though some wealth was preserved in a Swiss bank account denominated in gold. This appears to be a conversational tangent unrelated to any technical partnership discussions, development work, or project-related matters.\n\n## 2.

Key technical problems included plugin integration bugs that s acknowledged, with wallet fixes being resolved locally. A critical issue emerged regarding `MAX_EMBEDDING_TOKENS` missing from latest plugin versions - Wes proposed either using older plugin versions or submitting PRs to add the constant to all plugin repos.\n\nCharacter configuration was a recurring problem. azsxdc struggled with the agent defaulting to \"eliza\" personality instead of custom characters, and experienced model selection issues where claude-haiku-3.5 was used despite different configuration. Bill Ding announced he was implementing a character editor that day to address these issues. Currently, character creation is limited to onboarding setup only.\n\nTwitter plugin functionality had limitations - quote repost feature doesn't work properly, only posting quoted text with a link instead of native quote tweets. The agent successfully connected and posted to Twitter but lacked proper character customization.\n\nMochinoLabs proposed a significant architectural change: integrating PM2 as an external process manager for websocket management, suggesting a new directory structure using symlinks for better git-managed workflows. The proposed structure includes separate config directories for OpenClaw gateway, PM2 processes, and organized data/market directories.\n\nDeployment questions arose about VPS hosting versus local execution, and compatibility with elizaos examples. The community showed interest in testing, with ElBru planning to use milaidy setup as a homeschool project for his 10-year-old son, aligning with the project's accessibility goals.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Would milaidy support the examples from elizaos? Or do we need to run both Eliza and milaidy for full functionality? (asked by azsxdc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did anyone put milaidy on a vps? or running it locally only? (asked by azsxdc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I submit PRs to all plugin repos to add MAX_EMBEDDING_TOKENS to the latest or what direction should we go? (asked by Wes) A: Unanswered (s said \"let him cook\" suggesting Wes should proceed)\n\nQ: Where should I put the character files? It keeps defaulting to eliza (asked by azsxdc) A: There isn't a way other than the one you make in the onboarding (answered by Bill Ding)\n\nQ: Does Twitter plugin not allow quote reposts? (asked by azsxdc) A: No idea, you're welcome to make an issue or attempt to fix yourself (answered by Bill Ding)\n\nQ: Can you help me with the guide to add a new character for the agent? (asked by azsxdc) A: There isn't a way other than the one you make in the onboarding (answered by Bill Ding)\n\nQ: What is cluster mode? (asked by MochinoLabs) A: Unanswered (Odilitime asked this in response to PM2 suggestion)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat segment reveals a critical performance issue with the Eliza framework's database architecture. The primary technical discussion centered on the logs table causing significant performance degradation in PostgreSQL, which directly impacts Eliza response times. Sayonara identified this bottleneck, noting that the logs table is being hit excessively, creating a cascading slowdown effect on the entire system.\n\nStan acknowledged the issue and confirmed that a major optimization plan is already in development to address this database performance problem. This indicates the team is aware of the scalability challenges and has prioritized optimization work.\n\nA secondary discussion involved clarification about the Milaidy product branding, with Kenk noting a discrepancy between the URL and product name ('milaidy' vs 'milady.ai'), though this was a minor observational point rather than a technical issue requiring immediate resolution.\n\nThe conversation demonstrates active monitoring of production performance issues and proactive planning for infrastructure improvements, which are critical for maintaining system reliability as usage scales.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the logs table cause Eliza to slow down? (asked by sayonara) A: The logs table gets hit excessively which slows down postgres and then makes Eliza responses slower (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: Is there a plan to fix the database performance issues? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, we have a major optimization plan to implement, and that's part of it (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment reveals significant community frustration with the ELIZAOS token project rather than technical discussions. The primary concerns centered around token price decline (reported at $0.0013), lack of communication from the development team, and perceived mismanagement.\n\nKey developments mentioned include: escrow payment implementation for agent rentals (shared by M I A M I), and upcoming delistings from three Korean exchanges scheduled for 3:00 PM KST. The community raised critical questions about staking availability (confirmed unavailable by Arceon), token use-cases, and the status of five products promised months ago that remain undelivered.\n\nCommunity sentiment was predominantly negative, with holders expressing concerns about: continuous daily price drops exceeding 5%, key developers reportedly leaving the team, lack of marketing strategy, and poor community management practices including alleged muting/banning of critical voices. Some members speculated about potential token migration plans for March.\n\nLimited positive signals included mention of upcoming launches, a planned bullish video from \"crypto gains\" investor, and high traffic to ai.com causing website crashes. One developer (bigzee) posted availability for full-stack and AI development work with expertise in React, Node.js, Python, AI/ML frameworks, and various databases.\n\nThe overarching theme was community dissatisfaction with team transparency and accountability, with multiple users questioning the project's viability and requesting concrete updates on product development and token utility.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there any places to stake $ELIZAOS? (asked by mbat) A: No at the moment there is no staking (answered by Arceon)\n\nQ: Will team launch any token use-case or product which may use ElizaOS token? (asked by averma) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What about 5 products this team was about to deliver in few weeks - months gone? (asked by averma) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Do you even have a marketing team?
