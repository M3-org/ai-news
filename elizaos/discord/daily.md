## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Integration

**AI Workflow and Plugin Architecture**
The development community focused on expanding ElizaOS capabilities through plugin integration and workflow automation. **aicodeflow** initiated discussions around MVP development for Agentic AI-to-workflow integration, seeking collaborators for this development stage. **DigitalDiva** explored plugin compatibility for the milady personal AI assistant project, with **Odilitime** confirming that elizaos plugins can be integrated if they have a next branch available. **Kenk** directed developers to the official plugin creation guide at docs.elizaos.ai/guides/create-a-plugin for those wanting to build services for the ElizaOS ecosystem.

**Mobile and Documentation Tools**
**jin** announced improvements to mobile support for elizaos.news, enhancing accessibility for the community. **Stan** proposed adopting the HackMD MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration tool for team-wide collaborative note-taking and documentation, aiming to eliminate copy-pasting and facilitate easier sharing among team members.

### Security & Risk Detection

**Solana Rugpull Detection System**
**Vlt9** reported significant success with their latest live testing system, which successfully identified two major Solana rugpulls approximately 2 hours before their crashes. The system flagged DARKTRUMP as High-Risk while still trading at peak value, and also detected the NVIDIA token rugpull. Full documentation of these test results has been added to their docs, with test keys offered to interested community members.

### Business Development & Partnerships

**Grant Applications and Event Participation**
**ElizaBAO** shared important business updates, including meetings with Solana Foundation and SuperteamMYR, and announced that Clawlana submitted a Solana Grant application.

### Community Projects

**Silverizer23** discussed a Pumpfun Hackathon project's potential impact on the Eliza ecosystem on Solana, while **ElizaBAO** shared promotional links for BSC-related projects.

### User Support Issues

**shepa777** raised concerns about losing coins during a token migration process and sought help finding proper support channels. **Kenk** redirected the inquiry to be posted publicly in the channel rather than through DMs, though the specific migration issue remained unresolved, highlighting a potential gap in support infrastructure.
