# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Communication & Transparency

A significant portion of community discussion focused on the need for improved communication and transparency. Community members expressed frustration about irregular updates and the lack of weekly communication, particularly noting that month-long breaks between updates create vulnerability to FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) on social media platforms. The tension centered on community preference for regular scheduled updates versus the current milestone-based communication approach.

**Yojo** proposed a comprehensive solution involving automated AI agent-based communication systems that would deliver tailored updates across different channels (user dashboards, Discord, Twitter) using a PAR format (Problem-Action-Solution). This proposal suggested implementing optional weekly/topical updates inside existing account dashboards for Eliza/ElizaCloud.ai to improve customer retention, transparency, and expectation management. The concept was positioned as potentially becoming a white-label B2B product itself for automated customer service.

**Kenk** defended the current approach by pointing to existing roadmap and update channels, stating that updates occur when key milestones are reached rather than on a fixed schedule.

### Token Migration & Project Viability

The ElizaOS token migration was confirmed complete by **Odilitime**. However, community concerns emerged about price decline and whether the token has utility beyond being a meme coin. **Thau** provided crucial clarification that the project is actively developed (framework, agents, ElizaCloud, cross-chain work) and that price action doesn't indicate a rug pull. The core issue was identified as signal-to-noise ratio and communication clarity rather than fundamental project viability.

### Technical Development & Competitive Landscape

**DorianD** raised important competitive concerns by comparing ElizaOS unfavorably with OpenClaw, noting OpenClaw's simpler setup (4-minute wizard for WhatsApp/Telegram integration), system command toggles, and better user experience. Specific gaps identified included:
- WhatsApp integration (requested a year ago)
- Ability to run system commands
- Startup simplicity and onboarding experience

**Odilitime** demonstrated an assistant capable of taking over computers and running system-level commands, described as "openclaw packaged for highly online people" with a consumer version in development. The assistant features user-selectable voices and customizable themes/avatars, including the classic Eliza model.

Competition was noted from Shizuku (a16z-funded AI companion project) and concerns about losing mindshare to "AI slop projects." **Wes** acknowledged ElizaOS was ahead of its time as agent worlds proliferate.

### Infrastructure & Bug Fixes

**Odilitime** submitted pull request #6477 to fix the CI (Continuous Integration) system for the elizaOS/eliza repository. **Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE** reported a bug with the Babylon feedback feature, specifically that the "share to farcaster" link is displaying incorrectly.

### Developer Recruitment & Opportunities

Multiple developers posted availability messages seeking opportunities:
- **Callie** indicated availability
- **bigzee** (Full-Stack & AI Developer with React, Node.js, Python, AI/ML experience)
- **aicodeflow** (8 years AI and Automation engineering experience)

**Satsbased** actively recruited coders for an agentic payment app team.

## Community Help & Collaboration

**EMERSON3S** helped **worish** by clarifying that no staking portal exists currently on the new domain, saving the user from continued searching.

**Odilitime** assisted **DorianD** by explaining system-level command capabilities and user customization features including voice and avatar selection for the assistant.

**Thau** provided critical support to the broader community by addressing confusion and panic about price decline and potential rug pull concerns, offering factual clarification that migration is complete, the project is actively developed, and explaining the real issue is communication clarity not project viability.

**Kenk** helped **Biazs** by directing them to existing roadmap Discord channel and announcements channel, explaining the milestone-based update approach.

**Odilitime** responded to **bigzee** (developer seeking opportunities) by requesting to send information directly.
