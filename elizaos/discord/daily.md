# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Clarification and Migration Issues

A significant portion of discussion centered on confusion between $ai6z and $elizaos tokens. While initially confirmed as the same by community members, Odilitime clarified they are **different contracts** with ai16z worth significantly less than ElizaOS. Multiple users requested the ElizaOS contract address and were directed to the appropriate channel. Concerns were raised about:

- Users who missed the migration deadline seeking options to still migrate
- Token mintability questions remaining unanswered
- The rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS losing "memetic value" by switching to a "non-memetic ticker" (noted by DorianD)

### Technical Positioning and Comparisons

**ElizaOS vs OpenClaw:** When asked about differences, Odilitime provided concrete technical advantages:
- ElizaOS performs better on benchmarks
- Has more connectors available
- More reliable due to not being self-configuring

This represents an important technical positioning statement for the project.

### Community Engagement and Demonstrations

- **Babylon Discord Demo:** Odilitime promoted "the hanging plaza" as the best current demonstration of agents in action, directing new users interested in learning about agents in human digital spaces
- **Verification Milestone:** ElizaBAO announced ElizaOS received a golden checkmark verification
- **Hackathon Entry:** The Milady team submitted an entry on BSC that was shared for community voting
