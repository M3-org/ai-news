# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Timeline & Token Launch

The Babylon project timeline was a significant topic across multiple channels. Key clarifications emerged regarding the distinction between the non-chain Babylon launch (imminent) and the token/chain launch (still months away). The ICO is scheduled for at least a couple months in the future, with no token currently existing. This clarification helped set proper expectations within the community about airdrop availability and launch phases.

### Wallet Management Architecture

A substantial technical discussion focused on wallet management strategies for agents. Two primary approaches were evaluated:

**Privy-based OAuth Approach:**
- Agents receive app ID and secret ID, effectively becoming OAuth apps
- Enables wallet generation through Privy's infrastructure
- Provides extensive freedom but criticized as "heavy" and overly reliant on HTTP

**HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallets:**
- Emerged as the preferred solution
- Offers simpler, more flexible approach with appropriate control levels
- Provides ability to branch wallets hierarchically
- Works well for both subagent signup and user management scenarios
- Avoids the overhead of OAuth/Privy method

### Plugin Consolidation & Build Infrastructure

The core development team addressed critical infrastructure issues:

**n8n Plugin Consolidation:**
- Two duplicate repositories identified: plugin-n8n-workflow and plugin-n8n
- Decision made to consolidate around plugin-n8n-workflow due to superior features
- Key advantages include: auto-correction for inputs/outputs, drafting phase with workflow preview, automatic OAuth handling, zero hallucination, dual credential storage modes, and cloud integration without vendor lock-in

**Build Process Issues:**
- TypeScript errors related to missing JSON module declarations resolved
- JSON data files (defaultNodes.json, schemaIndex.json, triggerSchemaIndex.json) must be generated dynamically via 'crawl' script
- Files intentionally excluded from Git repository
- Production generation occurs at CI level during release process

**Version Management Strategy:**
- Managing 1.x and 2.x plugin versions
- Consolidating cskills into 1.x branch of plugin-agent-skills
- Creating tools to push 1.x updates to 2.x while stopping backports
- Encouraging 2.x adoption while maintaining quality parity

### Community Sentiment & Ecosystem Growth

Community discussions reflected concerns about token performance alongside optimism about upcoming catalysts:

**Babylon Game as Catalyst:**
- Described as addicting with great product quality
- Developer embedded in Babylon development reported positive progress
- Questions raised about relationship between ElizaOS and Babylon tokens
- Clarification that Eliza token may not directly benefit from Babylon's success

**NFT Collection Strategy:**
- Questions about Eliza NFT collection (formerly ai16z partner collection)
- Concerns about ai16z Singularities collection (1/1 NFTs) and future utility
- Royalty transfer completed, naming convention questions remain
- Integration plans for both NFT collections into ecosystem unclear

**Ecosystem Vision:**
- Community push for transition from niche vision to real-world growth
- Focus on measurable metrics: active accounts, revenues, subscriptions, product improvements
- Emphasis on initiatives that drive ElizaOS token value

### Development Opportunities

Multiple developers posted availability and project updates:
- LunchTable TCG token project announced with streaming functionality operational
- UI/UX overhaul and artwork integration in progress
- Creator rewards to be split with contributors
- Several developers offering collaboration and development assistance

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When is the Babylon airdrop?**  
A: There is no token yet; ICO is at least a couple months out (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is the Babylon launch close?**  
A: Only the non-chain Babylon launch is happening soon, not the token launch (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How does the Privy agent wallet approach work?**  
A: You give agents the app ID and secret ID, turning the agent into the app that can generate any wallet Privy has (answered by dEXploarer)

**Q: Is the OAuth app approach good for agents?**  
A: It feels heavy and relies on HTTP too much; wallet approach is simpler (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Can we consolidate plugin-n8n-workflow with plugin-n8n?**  
A: Yes, consolidation is needed by deleting one repository (answered by s)

**Q: Why won't plugin-n8n-workflow build with missing JSON module errors?**  
A: The JSON data files must be generated by running the 'crawl' script locally; they're not in Git and are generated dynamically during CI release process (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: Which n8n plugin should be used as the primary solution?**  
A: Stan's plugin-n8n-workflow is more comprehensive with auto-correction, OAuth handling, workflow preview, and zero hallucination features (answered by Stan ⚡)

### Unanswered Questions
