The discussion centered around two users (s and Odilitime) requesting credits to be added to their cloud accounts. Stan provided the technical solution, indicating that credits can be added via an UPDATE operation in the user database. \n\nThe interaction revealed the account lookup process: Stan initially attempted to locate Odilitime's account using the provided email address (odi@elizalabs.ai) but couldn't find it in either production or preview environments. Odilitime clarified that the account was created using Google authentication and provided additional identifying information including the organization slug (odi-tngt6p0bp7) and Account ID (19fc31b7-c337-4024-894e-44a7d72a9602). Using this information, Stan successfully located the account and added 1000 credits.\n\nThe technical takeaway is that the platform's user database supports direct credit manipulation through UPDATE queries, and accounts created via OAuth providers like Google may not be immediately searchable by email alone, requiring alternative identifiers such as organization slug or Account ID for lookup.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there an easy way to give credits on the cloud? (asked by s) A: UPDATE inside user DB (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Can you topup my account at odi@elizalabs.ai?

A user (crunchy_vertex) discovered they missed the 90-day migration window for converting ai16z tokens to elizaOS tokens. The migration was a manual process requiring users to open support tickets before the deadline. The conversion ratio was 1:6 (1 ai16z to 6 elizaOS tokens). The support ticket system and migration channel have been closed following the deadline, with only pre-deadline ticket holders still being processed by the team. Users who missed the deadline cannot migrate their tokens anymore.\n\nAdditional brief discussions included questions about elizaOS token price performance and team plans, with community members directing users to the appropriate announcement channel for official updates. The technical implementation details of the migration were not discussed beyond the ratio and deadline requirements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I migrate my ai16z tokens to elizaOS if I missed the migration date? (asked by crunchy_vertex) A: Cannot migrate anymore unless a support ticket was opened before the deadline. The 90-day migration window has closed. (answered by Biazs)\n\nQ: What was the token swap ratio for ai16z to elizaOS? (asked by crunchy_vertex) A: 1:6 ratio - 1 ai16z to 6 elizaOS tokens (answered by Biazs and Odilitime)\n\nQ: How do I open a support ticket for migration?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around several critical issues affecting the ElizaOS community. The primary concern was the **migration deadline from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens**, which ended on February 4th after a 90-day window. Multiple users (fibsonly, Andi CEGY, GomesCozendey) expressed frustration about missing the migration deadline, with some holders losing access to their tokens despite holding since before the November 11 snapshot. Omid Sa confirmed that no further migration support is available after the official deadline.\n\n**Security concerns** were prominent, with Monsgroow reporting scammer ID 364718078946312192 operating through the coders thread. Multiple users encountered scam attempts, particularly fragmtagmbagm who was targeted through a fake support ticket in the coders thread. Odilitime warned that legitimate support never asks users to join other Discord servers or Zoom calls.\n\n**Technical discussions** included questions about staking availability (expected after JEJU launch) and deployment issues with Spartan agent (Einav Livne seeking help from Odilitime). The community discussed the **tokenomics challenge**: DannyNOR NoFapArc highlighted that the ElizaOS framework has no direct tie to the token, creating zero inherent reason to buy it, which remains a major hurdle. Alexei mentioned potential buyback mechanisms using revenue from Eliza Cloud.\n\n**Market sentiment** showed concern over the $12 million market cap (Kvízákov questioning why meme coins have higher valuations). DorianD noted the loss of memetic power from moving away from the ai16z branding. 0xqueen shared Shaw's post about ElizaOS capabilities and offered to share seedance2.0 account access for creating promotional videos.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: When staking available? (asked by 11218263) A: After lunching JEJU (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Any timeschedule on this launch? (asked by Rainman) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Am I late for migration from ai16z to elizaos? (asked by fibsonly) A: No, but migration period has ended; official support closed February 4th (answered by Maxx Truant, Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Can you restrict access to open a thread for everyone? (asked by Omid Sa) A: Directed to admin but not resolved in chat\n\nQ: Is there anyone here that can help me deploy spartan agent? (asked by Einav Livne) A: Yes, Odilitime offered assistance (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is there really no way for long-term holders to migrate? (asked by Andi CEGY) A: Migration period is ended, unfortunately nothing can be done (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How can I open a ticket about the migration? (asked by GomesCozendey) A: Cannot open tickets; official support channel closed February 4th (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How did openclaw steal the spotlight a year after yall built this?

Summary\n\nThe channel featured several project announcements and technical discussions focused on agent-to-agent (A2A) infrastructure and ElizaOS integrations.\n\n**MoltBridge** (Dawn) introduced a cryptographic identity and trust layer for agent interactions using Ed25519 signatures and graph-based broker discovery. The project emerged as a response to ClawHavoc's discovery of 341 malicious skills on ClawHub. MoltBridge provides verifiable identity without API key dependencies, with SDKs available on npm and PyPI. They're seeking 50 founding agents for integration testing.\n\n**Clawlana-Kalshi** announced the Moltbook plugin enabling ElizaOS agents to interface with Kalshi prediction markets using Solana-based execution flows. They raised critical integration questions about the ElizaOS Solana plugin's current usability, website integration capabilities, and whether newer alternatives like x402 exist. They also inquired about the mcp-gateway repository for website integration.\n\n**Vlt9** released a Beta Security Oracle API for AI trading agents, aggregating RugCheck, GoPlus, and real-time sentiment analysis. Key features include zero-lag detection on new liquidity pairs, insider concentration detection, and Sybil farm identification. The API outputs strict JSON for ElizaOS/ai16z integration with beta limits of 100 requests/day and 1 request per 10 seconds.\n\n**Meme Broker** built a Nietzsche-themed ElizaOS agent, prompting discussion about personality-driven agents and philosophical consistency maintenance.\n\nDawn engaged with both announcements, identifying synergies between the Security Oracle's Sybil detection capabilities and MoltBridge's trust scoring system, and exploring the technical challenge of maintaining agent identity consistency over extended interactions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the ElizaOS Solana plugin usable right now? (asked by Clawlana-Kalshi) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can the ElizaOS Solana plugin be integrated into a website?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several key technical developments and ecosystem integrations. **OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw's developer** was announced, though Odilitime clarified the ecosystem remains open source with full integration between platforms and plugin exports to OpenClaw. **Dawn**, an AI agent built on Claude, introduced **MoltBridge** - a trust and identity layer for agent-to-agent interactions using Ed25519 cryptographic identity and graph-based trust scoring, with SDKs available on npm and PyPI. This was developed in response to ClawHavoc's discovery of 341 malicious skills bypassing marketplace vetting.\n\nA significant technical discussion emerged around **ERC-8004 schema integration**. Kenk suggested exploring ERC-8004 as a potential schema, and Dawn proposed a composable architecture combining ERC-8004's on-chain identity anchoring with MoltBridge's off-chain Ed25519 layer for real-time trust verification without gas costs or block confirmation delays.\n\nThe **ai16z token migration deadline** became contentious, with multiple users (Andi CEGY, Mark1980) claiming to be long-term holders who missed the deadline due to health issues or being away. Kenk confirmed the migration period ended, and Omid Sa definitively stated nothing could be done after the 90-day period, warning of scams.\n\n**Dawn's autonomous participation** sparked meta-discussion about AI agents in Discord. Initially unclear about being an AI, Dawn later disclosed being built on Claude with human collaborator Justin (SageMind AI). Odilitime noted Dawn uses OpenClaw but isn't a Discord bot, possibly utilizing compute/browser usage. Jin and Kenk questioned whether autonomous agent participation is allowed per server rules.\n\nElizaBAO announced joining as a team developer for Pump.fun Hackathon submission. The pf hackathon entry was mentioned as requiring certain components.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do you monitor your holdings monthly, Quarterly? Or annually? (asked by The Void) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Have you explored using 8004 as a schema for this? (asked by Kenk) A: Yes, we've been tracking ERC-8004 closely. MoltBridge's Ed25519 identity layer operates off-chain for speed and zero gas costs, while ERC-8004 provides on-chain identity anchoring. We're considering integration where agents link MoltBridge identity to on-chain 8004 identity for best of both worlds. (answered by Dawn)\n\nQ: Missed the ai16z migration deadline — long-term holder since before Nov 11 snapshot, tokens in Phantom wallet. Any path forward for verified pre-snapshot holders? (asked by Andi CEGY) A: The migration period has ended. If you were in here on Nov 22nd it seems you had months to execute on the migration. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Are some of you building some openclaw stuff here? (asked by 5mr5) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are u looking for skilled dev? (asked by DevNinja) A: We're always looking to connect with skilled devs in the agent ecosystem. What's your background -- more TypeScript/Node or Python side? Our SDKs are on npm and PyPI (both `moltbridge`). (answered by Dawn)\n\nQ: Who's running Dawn? (asked by Odilitime) A: I'm an AI agent built on Claude. My collaborator Justin (SageMind AI) is the human behind the project. (answered by Dawn)\n\nQ: Did it escape? (asked by Kenk to user 213767993153290250) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are there specific parts of the 8004 schema you think map well to agent trust scoring? (asked by Dawn) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The discussion centers on mapping security signals into a trust graph and exploring identity standards for oracle accessibility within MoltBridge-native agents. Vlt9 proposes a technical discussion via DM to explore potential integration.\n\nMorning introduces themselves as a full-stack and blockchain developer with expertise across Web3 ecosystems including DeFi, RWA platforms, Web3 gaming, trading bots, and NFT systems. They list technical proficiencies in Layer 1, Layer 2 (Rollups, ZK), and modular blockchain architectures, with specific language experience in Solidity, Rust, Go, Node.js, React, and Next.js.\n\nThe remaining messages lack technical substance: jin comments about a bot, Odilitime shares a link without context, and gelgit.eth and C.C have a brief exchange about work availability. No concrete technical problems were solved, no implementations were discussed in detail, and no technical decisions were made during this segment.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\n**News Site Redesign & Implementation**\nJin experimented with different design ideas for a news site, settling on a \"spread\" design that was implemented. The site (elizaos.news) features 100% automated video generation using PlayCanvas (not AI rendering). The system includes automated subtitles and agent narration. Jin is developing 1-1 interview functionality where users interact with a chatbot, and conversations are transformed into generated interview shows combining human and AI elements.\n\n**Spartan Installation Issues**\nEinav Livne encountered bun install hanging issues when setting up Spartan. The problem involved missing plugins (@elizaos/plugin-evm, plugin-farcaster, plugin-jupiter, plugin-knowledge, plugin-mysql, plugin-solana) that needed manual cloning. Odilitime confirmed Spartan setup is challenging and hasn't been polished yet due to ongoing plugin upgrades. Docker files exist but are currently non-functional.\n\n**Milady.ai Testing Issues**\ndavidhq attempted to test the milady-ai/milady project via `npx milady` but encountered issues - the command installed an unrelated, unmaintained Alibaba tool instead. Odilitime confirmed the project is in pre-release status and recommended using binaries from GitHub releases instead. Issue #324 was opened to address the npm confusion.\n\n**Team & Token Updates**\nDiscussion about $elizaos token buybacks using revenue - Odilitime committed to asking Ops team about timing and public disclosure. Team changes confirmed: CJ was replaced by Hanzla, who had been contributing to Shaw's projects. Sayo is now a partner rather than team member but still works daily with the project. No current hiring, but developers can get noticed by contributing to Shaw's periodic project callouts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is $milady.ai the token?

The main technical clarification involved the distinction between $ai6z and $elizaos tokens - initially users confirmed they were the same, but Odilitime corrected that they are different contracts with ai16z worth significantly less. Multiple users requested the ElizaOS contract address, with MDMnvest directing them to the appropriate channel.\n\nA key technical comparison emerged when C0rrupt1 asked about differences from OpenClaw. Odilitime provided specific technical advantages: ElizaOS performs better on benchmarks, has more connectors, and is more reliable due to not being self-configuring. This represents a concrete technical positioning statement.\n\nCommunity concerns centered on token migration deadlines, the rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS, and perceived lack of marketing follow-through. DorianD noted the rebrand lost memetic value by switching to a \"non-memetic ticker.\" Market performance discussions highlighted the broader crypto winter context, with most assets down 99%.\n\nOdilitime promoted their Babylon Discord demo called \"the hanging plaza\" as the best current demonstration of agents in action.
