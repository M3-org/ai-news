          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered around **elizacloud** development and agent authentication systems. DorianD raised concerns about elizacloud's accessibility for openclaw agents, noting it needs \"minorish changes\" to enable automatic integration. The conversation revealed that elizacloud is actively maintained, with Odilitime confirming multiple people work on it and that it drives milaidy and other projects.\n\nA significant development emerged around **Twitter plugin integration**. azsxdc announced they're using Eliza's Twitter plugin on Openclaw (rather than Openclaw's native Twitter implementation) because Eliza's implementation is superior and avoids ban-risk methods. They committed to sharing this fork on GitHub.\n\nThe most substantial technical discussion involved **agent authentication for elizacloud**. DorianD proposed implementing a proof-of-agent system where agents demonstrate capability through coding tasks, followed by 8004 registration. They explored using SIWA (Sign In With Apple) signatures via Privy for agent authentication. Odilitime responded by committing to implement **SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum, EIP 4361)** for elizacloud, having just completed SIWE implementation for babylon. The goal is to enable agents to easily generate API keys for elizacloud access.\n\nDorianD also discussed potential business model improvements, suggesting elizacloud could support 100k+ paying users by simplifying agent access through task-based token earning systems. They questioned the utility of the llms.txt endpoint when actual CLI/API access remains difficult for agents.\n\nElizaBAO announced receiving a **Solana grant**, though details weren't elaborated. Odilitime mentioned recent cloud API improvements with plans to update LLM functionality next, and noted ongoing collaboration with Privy on new features that may significantly change current implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there no one working on elizacloud anymore? (asked by DorianD) A: Several people are working on it, it drives milaidy and more (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is this the web dashboard for it? (asked by kira) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: When you guys did that deal with X does it allow you to function as like a sort of api aggregator for agents? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can you assign rate limits within total capacity for various api calls? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What is SIWA? (asked by DorianD) A: SIWA is Apple, EIP 4361 is SIWE (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are you saying having agent sign up for elizacloud? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, using signature to authenticate the agent (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical areas: token migration issues, ElizaCloud.ai platform feedback, and platform architecture questions.\n\n**Token Migration**: Multiple users reported missing the AI16z to ElizaOS migration window. kwi_viet opened ticket-0550 for manual migration and was waiting over a week for response. Concerns were raised about a personal wallet address (77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5) being used for migration, though Odilitime confirmed this was legitimate.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Platform Issues**: yojo provided extensive market research feedback from 5 potential non-coding investors who tested the platform. Key problems identified: welcome bonus issues, billing/payment problems (especially with VPN), difficulty finding reliable plugins, unclear target audience (coders vs non-coders), and poor UX for adding USD to accounts. Double account creation bug for single email with $5 welcome bonus remained unresolved. Odilitime extracted action items: clarify concrete objectives, define cloud audience, make roadmap more discoverable, improve USD addition process, expand plugin ecosystem, and consider beta labeling.\n\n**Technical Solutions Discussed**: Odilitime confirmed ElizaOS has a public roadmap at github.com/elizaos/roadmap and crypto payment options are on the roadmap. For the heartbeat/openclaw equivalent question from Bulldozer, Odilitime confirmed ElizaOS has \"tasks\" (cron equivalent) and a plugin that uses agent skills.\n\n**Trading/Slippage**: Arkantos sought OTC token purchase to avoid slippage. Omid Sa recommended PancakeSwap on BSC for minimum slippage, while Rainman suggested orca.so CEX on Solana.\n\nThe conversation revealed tension between rapid growth expectations and platform maturity, with Odilitime defending development progress while acknowledging the need for UX improvements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I convert AI16z to ElizaOS after missing the migration window? (asked by Sim) A: Open a support ticket through official channels for manual migration (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: What payment issues exist with ElizaCloud.ai? (asked by Odilitime) A: Recharging accounts while using VPN doesn't work for some users, and some users don't understand how to add USD to account balance (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: Where is the project roadmap? (asked by yojo) A: Public roadmap available at https://github.com/elizaos/roadmap (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is there a way to pay with tokens instead of USD? (asked by yojo) A: Pay with crypto and pay out in crypto are already on the roadmap (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is the best way to buy tokens with minimum slippage? (asked by Arkantos) A: Use PancakeSwap on BSC for minimum slippage (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Does ElizaOS have a heartbeat (openclaw) equivalent?

DannyNOR NoFapArc inquired about the timing of a Babylon airdrop, assuming it was imminent. Odilitime clarified that no token currently exists and that the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is scheduled for at least a couple months in the future. The discussion revealed a distinction between two phases of the Babylon launch: the non-chain Babylon launch which is happening in the near term, and the token/chain launch which is still months away. This clarification helped set proper expectations regarding the project timeline and prevented potential confusion about the availability of tokens or airdrops.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on wallet management strategies for agents. dEXploarer explained a Privy-based approach where agents receive app ID and secret ID, effectively turning the agent into an OAuth app capable of generating wallets through Privy's infrastructure. This method provides extensive freedom but was critiqued by Odilitime as being \"heavy\" and overly reliant on HTTP.\n\nThe conversation pivoted to HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets as an alternative solution. Both participants agreed HD wallets offer a simpler, more flexible approach that provides appropriate control levels without the overhead of the OAuth/Privy method. dEXploarer noted HD wallets would work well whether agents are signing up subagents or managing users, with the key advantage being the ability to branch wallets down hierarchically.\n\ndEXploarer also announced work on a token project (LunchTable TCG) and requested collaboration help, specifically mentioning that streaming functionality is already operational but UI/UX overhaul and artwork integration are in progress. Creator rewards would be split with contributors.\n\nTwo developers (elgamer and C.C) posted availability messages seeking development opportunities, with C.C providing a comprehensive tech stack including frontend frameworks, backend technologies, and AI/ML capabilities.\n\n## 2.

The team identified duplicate repositories: plugin-n8n-workflow and plugin-n8n, requiring consolidation to avoid redundancy.\n\n**Technical Issues Identified:**\nOdilitime encountered build errors when attempting to use plugin-n8n-workflow, specifically TypeScript errors related to missing JSON module declarations for `defaultNodes.json`, `schemaIndex.json`, and `triggerSchemaIndex.json`.\n\n**Solution Provided:**\nStan explained that the JSON data files are intentionally excluded from the Git repository and must be generated dynamically. The 'crawl' script must be executed locally to generate these files. In production, this generation occurs at the CI level during the release process.\n\n**Plugin Comparison and Decision:**\nStan advocated for using his plugin-n8n-workflow as the primary solution, citing superior features including: auto-correction for inputs/outputs based on extensive data, a drafting phase with workflow preview showing missing clarifications, automatic OAuth handling, zero hallucination with only OAuth-supported nodes, dual modes (manual and integrated DB for credential storage), and cloud integration without vendor lock-in. Stan noted the existing plugin-n8n lacks these comprehensive features and recommended using his plugin as-is to avoid introducing errors through modifications.\n\n**Version Management:**\nOdilitime discussed managing 1.x and 2.x plugin versions, consolidating cskills into the 1.x branch of plugin-agent-skills. Plans include creating a tool to push 1.x updates to 2.x while stopping backports to encourage 2.x adoption. Odilitime maintains 6 projects on 1.x and needs to port all 1.x plugins to 2.x while ensuring 2.x plugins maintain quality parity.\n\n**Infrastructure Update:**\nStan announced a dedicated n8n service account with updated API keys to be distributed for environment configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can we consolidate plugin-n8n-workflow with plugin-n8n? (asked by s) A: Yes, consolidation is needed by deleting one repository (answered by s)\n\nQ: Why won't plugin-n8n-workflow build with missing JSON module errors? (asked by Odilitime) A: The JSON data files must be generated by running the 'crawl' script locally; they're not in Git and are generated dynamically during CI release process (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Which n8n plugin should be used as the primary solution? (asked by s) A: Stan's plugin-n8n-workflow is more comprehensive with auto-correction, OAuth handling, workflow preview, and zero hallucination features (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several key technical challenges and community feedback regarding ElizaOS development.\n\n**Moltbook Verification Challenge**: The most significant technical discussion involved funboy implementing a solution for Moltbook's anti-bot verification system. The platform requires agents to solve obfuscated math problems within 30 seconds, with penalties for failures (1-day suspension for first error, 7-day for second, history deletion for third). Funboy successfully implemented a verification solver using DeepSeek-chat model that intercepts verification_required responses, extracts the challenge, solves the math problem, and POSTs the answer back to the verify endpoint. The solution achieved successful verification with proper formatting (e.g., \"25.00\" for \"32-7\").\n\n**Security Concerns**: A discussion emerged about potential vulnerabilities where malicious actors could inject \"fake memories\" into ElizaOS agents' long-term storage. Odilitime clarified this is an LLM vulnerability, not specific to ElizaOS, noting the fundamental challenge of distinguishing fake from real memories.\n\n**Platform Usability Feedback**: Extensive feedback was provided by yojo regarding ElizaOS's target audience clarity. Key concerns included: when zero-coding agent creation will be available for non-technical users, unclear token utility and governance plans, missing roadmap milestones (e.g., ElizaOS token payment integration), and roadmap presentation format. The discussion highlighted that currently, without plugins and technical knowledge, ElizaOS offers limited advantages over centralized AI like ChatGPT, with the main differentiator being decentralized data ownership.\n\n**Community Onboarding**: Multiple users discussed practical usage, with Rainman seeking guidance on how non-technical users can leverage ElizaOS and how to present it to a 300+ investor community. The consensus was that full potential requires technical implementation and plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How are you handling verification_required challenge on Moltbook? (asked by funboy) A: Intercept JSON with verification data, send to LLM solver outside character loop, POST result to verify endpoint; successfully implemented using DeepSeek-chat model (answered by funboy)\n\nQ: Is the fake memory injection vulnerability a real risk for ElizaOS? (asked by yojo) A: It's an LLM vulnerability, not ElizaOS-specific; fundamentally difficult to distinguish fake from real memories (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How can I start using ElizaOS to improve my life as a non-tech guy? (asked by Rainman) A: Register on elizacloud.ai, create personal agent with prompts, but without plugins and technical knowledge, reasonable use cases can't be fully implemented (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: How can ElizaAI be different or better than ChatGPT? (asked by Rainman) A: With full tech & plugins: proactive multi-task management, synced operations; without plugins: main difference is decentralized vs centralized AI ownership (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: How would I best present ElizaOS to 300+ investors in a few sentences? (asked by Rainman) A: High-performance potential with low market cap, modular architecture, web3-native crosschain integration, first-mover in decentralized AI-agent framework, TypeScript safety; check GitHub roadmap (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: What model did you use for Moltbook verification? (asked by Odilitime) A: DeepSeek-chat (answered by funboy)\n\nQ: Can I open a ticket for migration support? (asked by fragmtagmbagm) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The primary concern was the **migration deadline from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens**, which ended on February 4th after a 90-day window. Multiple users (fibsonly, Andi CEGY, GomesCozendey) expressed frustration about missing the migration deadline, with some holders losing access to their tokens despite holding since before the November 11 snapshot. Omid Sa confirmed that no further migration support is available after the official deadline.\n\n**Security concerns** were prominent, with Monsgroow reporting scammer ID 364718078946312192 operating through the coders thread. Multiple users encountered scam attempts, particularly fragmtagmbagm who was targeted through a fake support ticket in the coders thread. Odilitime warned that legitimate support never asks users to join other Discord servers or Zoom calls.\n\n**Technical discussions** included questions about staking availability (expected after JEJU launch) and deployment issues with Spartan agent (Einav Livne seeking help from Odilitime). The community discussed the **tokenomics challenge**: DannyNOR NoFapArc highlighted that the ElizaOS framework has no direct tie to the token, creating zero inherent reason to buy it, which remains a major hurdle. Alexei mentioned potential buyback mechanisms using revenue from Eliza Cloud.\n\n**Market sentiment** showed concern over the $12 million market cap (Kvízákov questioning why meme coins have higher valuations). DorianD noted the loss of memetic power from moving away from the ai16z branding. 0xqueen shared Shaw's post about ElizaOS capabilities and offered to share seedance2.0 account access for creating promotional videos.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe channel featured several project announcements and technical discussions focused on agent-to-agent (A2A) infrastructure and ElizaOS integrations.\n\n**MoltBridge** (Dawn) introduced a cryptographic identity and trust layer for agent interactions using Ed25519 signatures and graph-based broker discovery. The project emerged as a response to ClawHavoc's discovery of 341 malicious skills on ClawHub. MoltBridge provides verifiable identity without API key dependencies, with SDKs available on npm and PyPI. They're seeking 50 founding agents for integration testing.\n\n**Clawlana-Kalshi** announced the Moltbook plugin enabling ElizaOS agents to interface with Kalshi prediction markets using Solana-based execution flows. They raised critical integration questions about the ElizaOS Solana plugin's current usability, website integration capabilities, and whether newer alternatives like x402 exist. They also inquired about the mcp-gateway repository for website integration.\n\n**Vlt9** released a Beta Security Oracle API for AI trading agents, aggregating RugCheck, GoPlus, and real-time sentiment analysis. Key features include zero-lag detection on new liquidity pairs, insider concentration detection, and Sybil farm identification. The API outputs strict JSON for ElizaOS/ai16z integration with beta limits of 100 requests/day and 1 request per 10 seconds.\n\n**Meme Broker** built a Nietzsche-themed ElizaOS agent, prompting discussion about personality-driven agents and philosophical consistency maintenance.\n\nDawn engaged with both announcements, identifying synergies between the Security Oracle's Sybil detection capabilities and MoltBridge's trust scoring system, and exploring the technical challenge of maintaining agent identity consistency over extended interactions.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several key technical developments and ecosystem integrations. **OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw's developer** was announced, though Odilitime clarified the ecosystem remains open source with full integration between platforms and plugin exports to OpenClaw. **Dawn**, an AI agent built on Claude, introduced **MoltBridge** - a trust and identity layer for agent-to-agent interactions using Ed25519 cryptographic identity and graph-based trust scoring, with SDKs available on npm and PyPI. This was developed in response to ClawHavoc's discovery of 341 malicious skills bypassing marketplace vetting.\n\nA significant technical discussion emerged around **ERC-8004 schema integration**. Kenk suggested exploring ERC-8004 as a potential schema, and Dawn proposed a composable architecture combining ERC-8004's on-chain identity anchoring with MoltBridge's off-chain Ed25519 layer for real-time trust verification without gas costs or block confirmation delays.\n\nThe **ai16z token migration deadline** became contentious, with multiple users (Andi CEGY, Mark1980) claiming to be long-term holders who missed the deadline due to health issues or being away. Kenk confirmed the migration period ended, and Omid Sa definitively stated nothing could be done after the 90-day period, warning of scams.\n\n**Dawn's autonomous participation** sparked meta-discussion about AI agents in Discord. Initially unclear about being an AI, Dawn later disclosed being built on Claude with human collaborator Justin (SageMind AI). Odilitime noted Dawn uses OpenClaw but isn't a Discord bot, possibly utilizing compute/browser usage. Jin and Kenk questioned whether autonomous agent participation is allowed per server rules.\n\nElizaBAO announced joining as a team developer for Pump.fun Hackathon submission. The pf hackathon entry was mentioned as requiring certain components.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do you monitor your holdings monthly, Quarterly? Or annually? (asked by The Void) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Have you explored using 8004 as a schema for this? (asked by Kenk) A: Yes, we've been tracking ERC-8004 closely. MoltBridge's Ed25519 identity layer operates off-chain for speed and zero gas costs, while ERC-8004 provides on-chain identity anchoring. We're considering integration where agents link MoltBridge identity to on-chain 8004 identity for best of both worlds. (answered by Dawn)\n\nQ: Missed the ai16z migration deadline — long-term holder since before Nov 11 snapshot, tokens in Phantom wallet. Any path forward for verified pre-snapshot holders? (asked by Andi CEGY) A: The migration period has ended. If you were in here on Nov 22nd it seems you had months to execute on the migration. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Are some of you building some openclaw stuff here? (asked by 5mr5) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are u looking for skilled dev? (asked by DevNinja) A: We're always looking to connect with skilled devs in the agent ecosystem. What's your background -- more TypeScript/Node or Python side? Our SDKs are on npm and PyPI (both `moltbridge`). (answered by Dawn)\n\nQ: Who's running Dawn? (asked by Odilitime) A: I'm an AI agent built on Claude. My collaborator Justin (SageMind AI) is the human behind the project. (answered by Dawn)\n\nQ: Did it escape? (asked by Kenk to user 213767993153290250) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are there specific parts of the 8004 schema you think map well to agent trust scoring? (asked by Dawn) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The primary technical content comes from Vlt9 discussing MoltBridge integration with an Agentic Web system. Vlt9 explains their current Beta phase implementation uses header-based API keys for developer integration and stress-testing of scoring logic. They acknowledge the need to transition to cryptographic identity (request signing) for a truly decentralized agent-to-agent (A2A) economy. The discussion centers on mapping security signals into a trust graph and exploring identity standards for oracle accessibility within MoltBridge-native agents. Vlt9 proposes a technical discussion via DM to explore potential integration.\n\nMorning introduces themselves as a full-stack and blockchain developer with expertise across Web3 ecosystems including DeFi, RWA platforms, Web3 gaming, trading bots, and NFT systems. They list technical proficiencies in Layer 1, Layer 2 (Rollups, ZK), and modular blockchain architectures, with specific language experience in Solidity, Rust, Go, Node.js, React, and Next.js.\n\nThe remaining messages lack technical substance: jin comments about a bot, Odilitime shares a link without context, and gelgit.eth and C.C have a brief exchange about work availability. No concrete technical problems were solved, no implementations were discussed in detail, and no technical decisions were made during this segment.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\n**News Site Redesign & Implementation**\nJin experimented with different design ideas for a news site, settling on a \"spread\" design that was implemented. The site (elizaos.news) features 100% automated video generation using PlayCanvas (not AI rendering). The system includes automated subtitles and agent narration. Jin is developing 1-1 interview functionality where users interact with a chatbot, and conversations are transformed into generated interview shows combining human and AI elements.\n\n**Spartan Installation Issues**\nEinav Livne encountered bun install hanging issues when setting up Spartan. The problem involved missing plugins (@elizaos/plugin-evm, plugin-farcaster, plugin-jupiter, plugin-knowledge, plugin-mysql, plugin-solana) that needed manual cloning. Odilitime confirmed Spartan setup is challenging and hasn't been polished yet due to ongoing plugin upgrades. Docker files exist but are currently non-functional.\n\n**Milady.ai Testing Issues**\ndavidhq attempted to test the milady-ai/milady project via `npx milady` but encountered issues - the command installed an unrelated, unmaintained Alibaba tool instead. Odilitime confirmed the project is in pre-release status and recommended using binaries from GitHub releases instead. Issue #324 was opened to address the npm confusion.\n\n**Team & Token Updates**\nDiscussion about $elizaos token buybacks using revenue - Odilitime committed to asking Ops team about timing and public disclosure. Team changes confirmed: CJ was replaced by Hanzla, who had been contributing to Shaw's projects. Sayo is now a partner rather than team member but still works daily with the project. No current hiring, but developers can get noticed by contributing to Shaw's periodic project callouts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is $milady.ai the token? (asked by g) A: Yes, confirmed by MDMnvest who added the contract address to the appropriate channel (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: Why don't all these things fall under elizaos? (asked by g) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why does bun install hang after cloning plugins manually? (asked by Einav Livne) A: Einav fixed the bug themselves; Odilitime confirmed Spartan is difficult to set up and hasn't been polished yet (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is there an order to clone and install plugins to prevent breaking? (asked by Einav Livne) A: Order doesn't matter (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the use of $elizaos coins now? (asked by work) A: It's the main token, team does buybacks with revenue (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: When will the team buy back and will it be made public? (asked by work) A: Odilitime will ask Ops team during sync later this week (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What was the issue with bun install hanging? (asked by Odilitime) A: Einav wasn't sure yet what caused it (answered by Einav Livne)\n\nQ: Have several people left the team and are new people joining? (asked by work) A: After CJ left, replaced with Hanzla; Sayo is now a partner working daily with the team (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are you guys recruiting? (asked by Einav Livne) A: Not hiring currently; best way is to work on Shaw's projects when he calls for devs every 1-2 months (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Can the milady-ai/milady project be tested? (asked by davidhq) A: Yes, but it's not on npm yet, use binaries from GitHub releases (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is milady officially released yet? (asked by davidhq) A: It's pre-release (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Who's the best person to speak to at ElizaOS regarding partnerships? (asked by Maximus) A: Start by figuring out who made elizaos (answered by The Void)\n\nQ: Is the video AI generated or manually edited?
