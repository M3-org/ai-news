Summary\n\nThis chat segment focuses on a technical issue with the ElizaCloud platform involving account management and credit allocation problems. The user **yojo** reported experiencing duplicate account creation when attempting to claim a $5 welcome credit. \n\nThe core technical issue involves two separate accounts being created under the same email address:\n- Account 1: Original registration directly on elizacloud.ai with 27 cents balance, where an agent initially disappeared but later reappeared\n- Account 2: Created when clicking the \"get started\" link in the welcome email, which redirects to dev.elizacloud.ai (a different subdomain) with only $1 initial balance instead of the promised $5 credit\n\nThe problem appears to stem from the email link directing users to a development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) rather than the production environment (elizacloud.ai), causing account fragmentation and failure to properly credit the promotional $5. The user created separate agents in both accounts due to this confusion.\n\n**yojo** also raised security concerns about sharing email addresses on Discord due to phishing risks. The platform administrators **Odilitime** and **sam** offered to handle the issue through direct messages to resolve the account consolidation and credit allocation problem privately.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I share my email to avoid getting spammed or phished on Discord? (asked by yojo) A: You can DM Odilitime or sam directly (answered by Odilitime and sam)\n\nQ: Why do I have two accounts assigned to the same email on ElizaCloud? (asked by yojo) A: One account was created on elizacloud.ai and another on dev.elizacloud.ai when clicking the email link (answered by yojo - self-clarification)\n\nQ: Why didn't I receive the $5 welcome credit when clicking the email link? (asked by yojo) A: The email link created a new account on dev.elizacloud.ai with only $1 instead of adding $5 to the existing account (answered by yojo - self-clarification)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe chat segment focused on the production release of Babylon, a game platform with agent-based trading functionality. **puncar** announced the production-ready version and provided detailed onboarding instructions for the team. The access flow requires logging in via babylon.market using ElizaLabs email credentials, which grants admin status and bypasses NFT gating requirements. Users can then access play.babylon.market to interact with agents, trade in the terminal, and explore the feed.\n\nA critical bug was immediately identified during testing. **ziflie** discovered a profile image upload failure that returned a \"Failed to update profile\" error when attempting to select custom profile images. **puncar** acknowledged and submitted the bug for resolution. **tcm390** implemented and merged a fix for the profile update issue. Post-fix testing by **ziflie** confirmed the issue was resolved successfully.\n\nThe team was encouraged to provide feedback through either the integrated green feedback button or direct messages to puncar, and optionally create screen recordings with transcripts using Google Meet to capture the complete end-to-end user experience.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I access the Babylon game? (asked by puncar) A: Log in at babylon.market with ElizaLabs email for admin status, then go to play.babylon.market to start playing (answered by puncar)\n\nQ: What can I do in the game? (asked by puncar) A: Spin up agents, talk to them, trade with them in the terminal, and explore the feed (answered by puncar)\n\nQ: How should I provide feedback?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main topics: token migration issues, ElizaOS technical developments, and platform technical support.\n\n**Token Migration Controversy**: A significant portion of the conversation involved users debating the 90-day migration deadline that recently closed. Multiple community members (TanviSinghwal92, V33, Kenk) defended the timeline as sufficient, noting the migration was communicated since March and postponed from October to November. Kenk explained there are ongoing maintenance overheads and human support costs associated with keeping the migration portal open indefinitely, justifying the deadline. Users who missed the deadline were criticized for not monitoring their holdings or opening support tickets before the cutoff.\n\n**ElizaOS Technical Developments**: The project announced cross-chain expansion beyond Solana to Ethereum. The Void confirmed \"Elizaos is crosschain now.\" Discussion highlighted ElizaOS's utility for autonomous agents performing on-chain work, including managing protocol liquidity and orchestrating DeFi workflows, though chomppp questioned when these features would be implemented. The Babylon Monkey game is currently in beta testing for points farming and airdrops.\n\n**Technical Support Issues**: A user (∙∙·▫▫ᴼⒻⓄⓍⓏⓎᴼ▫▫·∙∙) reported ElizaCloud login issues where the dashboard kept cycling between login and dashboard screens. Odilitime forwarded this to the cloud team for investigation and requested the user's email via DM for follow-up.\n\n**Community Announcements**: kirsten launched BuildAMolt, a hosted solution for Moltbots and Moltbook on private VPS with 2-minute setup, eliminating the need for local instances. A security matter was raised by memi seeking team contact for private discussion.\n\nMarket conditions were briefly discussed, with Arceon noting Bitcoin's drop from 92k to 60k in under 3 weeks, attributing liquidity issues across all cryptocurrencies to capital leaving the market.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why is liquidity on dexes so little? (asked by BOSSBEURNI) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Who can I DM about a security-related matter? (asked by memi) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is Eliza down? (asked by ∙∙·▫▫ᴼⒻⓄⓍⓏⓎᴼ▫▫·∙∙) A: The login works but dashboard keeps cycling between login and dashboard screens; forwarded to cloud team (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does ELIZAOS enable on Ethereum if it's on Solana?

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered around two main topics: a limited-time Opus 4.6 access announcement and recruitment for testing next-generation Eliza software.\n\nOdilitime announced that Opus 4.6 is available free on bolt.new for 48 hours, though noted some unspecified limitations exist with the service.\n\nThe primary technical focus was on the milady.ai project (GitHub: milady-ai/milaidy), with s requesting help squashing bugs and getting the project to production. This sparked significant community interest, with multiple experienced developers volunteering for testing roles.\n\nWes took immediate action on the milady repository, demonstrating initiative by creating 3 pull requests to address bugs. He sought clarification on the contribution process, specifically asking whether the workflow should be: log bugs as issues, submit fixes via PRs, and tag the related issues. Wes mentioned using Claude Code Max for development work and identified himself as both a project investor and full-time software engineer. He paused further contributions pending process confirmation to avoid overwhelming the review queue.\n\nMultiple community members responded to an X (Twitter) post about testing next-generation Eliza, including developers with various backgrounds: Prolific Mind (built autonomous framework with ERC-8004), Wes (ElizaOS agents, Lang Graph, RAG apps experience), One Frequency United (25 years tech experience), and Maarmapa (self-identified bug hunter). Kenk directed interested testers to a specific location (context unclear from transcript).\n\nThe discussion showed strong community engagement with volunteers offering diverse technical skills for testing and development work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I participate in testing of next gen eliza? (asked by Ramobo) A: Unanswered directly, though Kenk later directed testers to jump into an unspecified location\nQ: What is the process for contributing to the milady repo - should we log bugs as issues and submit fixes with PRs tagging the issue?

User 's' shared sprites.dev and proposed a scaling strategy of keeping one instance hot and paying per usage for efficiency. \n\nThe milaidy project (https://github.com/milady-ai/milaidy) is positioned as a Mac-native application with several key features: runs as a simple .app on Mac, uses agent skills similar to openclaw, includes all openclaw connectors as Eliza plugins, and maintains a minimal bloat architecture through plugin-based design. The project uses openclaw with \"pi agent\" under the hood, though 's' notes that while pi is technically sound, it lacks memetic appeal compared to \"the lobster\" branding.\n\n's' explicitly requested help with the project, suggesting it has significant potential. There was consideration to name it \"eliza\" but opted for something more memetic instead, leading to the milady.ai branding.\n\nA critical strategic discussion emerged when Borko raised concerns about branding strategy. Borko argued that the project should be Eliza-branded to capture brand and network effects for the broader ecosystem, particularly for the Eliza app (described as the retail version). The concern was that using Milaidy branding would divert mindshare away from the company's core products.\n\nOdilitime proposed a compromise solution: maintain separate brands but implement cross-promotion strategies to ensure both projects benefit each other rather than competing for attention.\n\n## 2.

Markhor expressed disappointment with the price, while Biazs emphasized the need for marketing push with upcoming launches. A debate emerged about whether the team cares about price - gby claimed the team leader stated on X they don't care about price, while Biazs countered that higher prices benefit the team's operational expenses.

A critical issue emerged regarding `MAX_EMBEDDING_TOKENS` missing from latest plugin versions - Wes proposed either using older plugin versions or submitting PRs to add the constant to all plugin repos.\n\nCharacter configuration was a recurring problem. azsxdc struggled with the agent defaulting to \"eliza\" personality instead of custom characters, and experienced model selection issues where claude-haiku-3.5 was used despite different configuration. Bill Ding announced he was implementing a character editor that day to address these issues. Currently, character creation is limited to onboarding setup only.\n\nTwitter plugin functionality had limitations - quote repost feature doesn't work properly, only posting quoted text with a link instead of native quote tweets. The agent successfully connected and posted to Twitter but lacked proper character customization.\n\nMochinoLabs proposed a significant architectural change: integrating PM2 as an external process manager for websocket management, suggesting a new directory structure using symlinks for better git-managed workflows. The proposed structure includes separate config directories for OpenClaw gateway, PM2 processes, and organized data/market directories.\n\nDeployment questions arose about VPS hosting versus local execution, and compatibility with elizaos examples. The community showed interest in testing, with ElBru planning to use milaidy setup as a homeschool project for his 10-year-old son, aligning with the project's accessibility goals.\n\n## 2.

Sayonara identified this bottleneck, noting that the logs table is being hit excessively, creating a cascading slowdown effect on the entire system.\n\nStan acknowledged the issue and confirmed that a major optimization plan is already in development to address this database performance problem. This indicates the team is aware of the scalability challenges and has prioritized optimization work.\n\nA secondary discussion involved clarification about the Milaidy product branding, with Kenk noting a discrepancy between the URL and product name ('milaidy' vs 'milady.ai'), though this was a minor observational point rather than a technical issue requiring immediate resolution.\n\nThe conversation demonstrates active monitoring of production performance issues and proactive planning for infrastructure improvements, which are critical for maintaining system reliability as usage scales.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the logs table cause Eliza to slow down? (asked by sayonara) A: The logs table gets hit excessively which slows down postgres and then makes Eliza responses slower (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: Is there a plan to fix the database performance issues?

Summary\n\nThis chat segment reveals significant community frustration with the ELIZAOS token project rather than technical discussions. The primary concerns centered around token price decline (reported at $0.0013), lack of communication from the development team, and perceived mismanagement.\n\nKey developments mentioned include: escrow payment implementation for agent rentals (shared by M I A M I), and upcoming delistings from three Korean exchanges scheduled for 3:00 PM KST. The community raised critical questions about staking availability (confirmed unavailable by Arceon), token use-cases, and the status of five products promised months ago that remain undelivered.\n\nCommunity sentiment was predominantly negative, with holders expressing concerns about: continuous daily price drops exceeding 5%, key developers reportedly leaving the team, lack of marketing strategy, and poor community management practices including alleged muting/banning of critical voices. Some members speculated about potential token migration plans for March.\n\nLimited positive signals included mention of upcoming launches, a planned bullish video from \"crypto gains\" investor, and high traffic to ai.com causing website crashes. One developer (bigzee) posted availability for full-stack and AI development work with expertise in React, Node.js, Python, AI/ML frameworks, and various databases.\n\nThe overarching theme was community dissatisfaction with team transparency and accountability, with multiple users questioning the project's viability and requesting concrete updates on product development and token utility.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there any places to stake $ELIZAOS? (asked by mbat) A: No at the moment there is no staking (answered by Arceon)\n\nQ: Will team launch any token use-case or product which may use ElizaOS token?

Summary\n\nThe discussion channel was dominated by community concerns about token price decline, exchange delistings, and perceived lack of team communication. The primary technical issue discussed was the Korean exchange delisting situation - there was significant confusion about whether ELIZAOS was being delisted from Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. User gby claimed the delisting was confirmed and scheduled, while davidhq and paolin later clarified that only the pre-rebrand AI16Z token was delisted, not the current ELIZAOS token.\n\nA critical migration issue emerged when user ufw discovered they had missed the ai16z to ELIZA token migration deadline, asking if their tokens were lost. This question went unanswered by team members.\n\nTechnical development updates were minimal but included: jin posting a weekly roundup video of ElizaOS updates, yojo providing feedback on elizacloud.ai UX optimization needs (suggesting prompt-only user features, visual generation optimization, plug-in marketplace, and crypto transfers without wallet connect), and Seppmos sharing a video covering Babylon and Hyperscape developments.\n\nCommunity sentiment was largely negative, with multiple users (averma, gby, Gem Hunter) expressing concerns about: lack of token utility, team selling tokens (specifically Shaw's wallet DScqtGwFoDTme2Rzdjpdb2w7CtuKc6Z8KF7hMhbx8ugQ being monitored), developers leaving the project (CJ and another unnamed dev), and absence of admin/team presence in the channel. User ovo defended the team, noting Shaw covered unexpected costs to recover the X account and that the team burned 22M tokens. The discussion revealed deep frustration from token holders who felt the open-source development work wasn't translating to token value or holder benefits.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where can I bridge eliza token from solana to bsc?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main themes: token migration concerns, communication/transparency issues, and technical comparisons with competitors.\n\n**Token Migration & Project Status:**\nThe ElizaOS token migration was confirmed complete by Odilitime. Community members expressed frustration about price decline and questioned whether the token has utility beyond being a meme coin. Thau provided a comprehensive response clarifying that the project is actively developed (framework, agents, ElizaCloud, cross-chain work) and that price action doesn't indicate a rug pull. The core issue identified was signal-to-noise ratio and communication clarity rather than project viability.\n\n**Communication & Roadmap Concerns:**\nBiazs raised significant concerns about irregular updates and lack of weekly communication, noting that month-long breaks hurt the project amid daily rugpull FUD on X. Kenk responded by pointing to existing roadmap and update channels, stating updates occur when key milestones are reached. The debate highlighted tension between community desire for regular scheduled updates versus milestone-based communication. Yojo suggested implementing automated AI agent-based communication systems for different channels (user dashboards, Discord, Twitter) with tailored PAR format (Problem-Action-Solution) updates, proposing this could become a B2B product itself.\n\n**Technical Discussions:**\nDorianD compared ElizaOS unfavorably with OpenClaw, noting OpenClaw's simpler setup (4-minute wizard for WhatsApp/Telegram integration), system command toggles, and better user experience. Specific gaps identified: WhatsApp integration requested a year ago, ability to run system commands, and startup simplicity. Wes acknowledged ElizaOS was ahead of its time as agent worlds proliferate. Competition noted includes Shizuku (a16z-funded AI companion project) and concerns about losing mindshare to \"AI slop projects.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the ElizaOS token migration over? (asked by Zoking_b) A: Yes it is (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does the Eliza coin currently have utility features, or is it just a meme coin? (asked by Zoking_b) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is Babylon going to be released soon? (asked by g) A: Babylon has been in \"will release in a couple of weeks\" state for like 4 months (answered by Biazs)\n\nQ: Where can I find the roadmap and updates? (asked by Biazs) A: Roadmap is available in linked Discord channel, updates in announcements channel, and Shaw updates via X whenever anything happens (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: How often will the roadmap be updated? (asked by Biazs) A: We will update against the roadmap when key milestones are reached (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

DorianD raised concerns about elizacloud's accessibility for openclaw agents, noting it needs \"minorish changes\" to enable automatic integration. The conversation revealed that elizacloud is actively maintained, with Odilitime confirming multiple people work on it and that it drives milaidy and other projects.\n\nA significant development emerged around **Twitter plugin integration**. azsxdc announced they're using Eliza's Twitter plugin on Openclaw (rather than Openclaw's native Twitter implementation) because Eliza's implementation is superior and avoids ban-risk methods. They committed to sharing this fork on GitHub.\n\nThe most substantial technical discussion involved **agent authentication for elizacloud**. DorianD proposed implementing a proof-of-agent system where agents demonstrate capability through coding tasks, followed by 8004 registration. They explored using SIWA (Sign In With Apple) signatures via Privy for agent authentication. Odilitime responded by committing to implement **SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum, EIP 4361)** for elizacloud, having just completed SIWE implementation for babylon. The goal is to enable agents to easily generate API keys for elizacloud access.\n\nDorianD also discussed potential business model improvements, suggesting elizacloud could support 100k+ paying users by simplifying agent access through task-based token earning systems. They questioned the utility of the llms.txt endpoint when actual CLI/API access remains difficult for agents.\n\nElizaBAO announced receiving a **Solana grant**, though details weren't elaborated.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical areas: token migration issues, ElizaCloud.ai platform feedback, and platform architecture questions.\n\n**Token Migration**: Multiple users reported missing the AI16z to ElizaOS migration window. kwi_viet opened ticket-0550 for manual migration and was waiting over a week for response. Concerns were raised about a personal wallet address (77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5) being used for migration, though Odilitime confirmed this was legitimate.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Platform Issues**: yojo provided extensive market research feedback from 5 potential non-coding investors who tested the platform. Key problems identified: welcome bonus issues, billing/payment problems (especially with VPN), difficulty finding reliable plugins, unclear target audience (coders vs non-coders), and poor UX for adding USD to accounts. Double account creation bug for single email with $5 welcome bonus remained unresolved. Odilitime extracted action items: clarify concrete objectives, define cloud audience, make roadmap more discoverable, improve USD addition process, expand plugin ecosystem, and consider beta labeling.\n\n**Technical Solutions Discussed**: Odilitime confirmed ElizaOS has a public roadmap at github.com/elizaos/roadmap and crypto payment options are on the roadmap. For the heartbeat/openclaw equivalent question from Bulldozer, Odilitime confirmed ElizaOS has \"tasks\" (cron equivalent) and a plugin that uses agent skills.\n\n**Trading/Slippage**: Arkantos sought OTC token purchase to avoid slippage. Omid Sa recommended PancakeSwap on BSC for minimum slippage, while Rainman suggested orca.so CEX on Solana.\n\nThe conversation revealed tension between rapid growth expectations and platform maturity, with Odilitime defending development progress while acknowledging the need for UX improvements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I convert AI16z to ElizaOS after missing the migration window? (asked by Sim) A: Open a support ticket through official channels for manual migration (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: What payment issues exist with ElizaCloud.ai? (asked by Odilitime) A: Recharging accounts while using VPN doesn't work for some users, and some users don't understand how to add USD to account balance (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: Where is the project roadmap? (asked by yojo) A: Public roadmap available at https://github.com/elizaos/roadmap (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is there a way to pay with tokens instead of USD? (asked by yojo) A: Pay with crypto and pay out in crypto are already on the roadmap (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is the best way to buy tokens with minimum slippage? (asked by Arkantos) A: Use PancakeSwap on BSC for minimum slippage (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Does ElizaOS have a heartbeat (openclaw) equivalent? (asked by Bulldozer | dozer.finance) A: Yes, ElizaOS has \"tasks\" which serve as the cron equivalent (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Would an Eliza agent be able to install and run instructions made for AI agents? (asked by Bulldozer | dozer.finance) A: Yes, there is a plugin that uses agent skills (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is the wallet address 77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5 legitimate for migration? (asked by kwi_vn) A: Yes (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Can I use orca.so for trading? (asked by Arkantos) A: Yes, you can try orca.so CEX on Solana (answered by Rainman)\n\n## 3.

DannyNOR NoFapArc inquired about the timing of a Babylon airdrop, assuming it was imminent. Odilitime clarified that no token currently exists and that the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is scheduled for at least a couple months in the future. The discussion revealed a distinction between two phases of the Babylon launch: the non-chain Babylon launch which is happening in the near term, and the token/chain launch which is still months away. This clarification helped set proper expectations regarding the project timeline and prevented potential confusion about the availability of tokens or airdrops.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on wallet management strategies for agents. dEXploarer explained a Privy-based approach where agents receive app ID and secret ID, effectively turning the agent into an OAuth app capable of generating wallets through Privy's infrastructure. This method provides extensive freedom but was critiqued by Odilitime as being \"heavy\" and overly reliant on HTTP.\n\nThe conversation pivoted to HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets as an alternative solution. Both participants agreed HD wallets offer a simpler, more flexible approach that provides appropriate control levels without the overhead of the OAuth/Privy method. dEXploarer noted HD wallets would work well whether agents are signing up subagents or managing users, with the key advantage being the ability to branch wallets down hierarchically.\n\ndEXploarer also announced work on a token project (LunchTable TCG) and requested collaboration help, specifically mentioning that streaming functionality is already operational but UI/UX overhaul and artwork integration are in progress. Creator rewards would be split with contributors.\n\nTwo developers (elgamer and C.C) posted availability messages seeking development opportunities, with C.C providing a comprehensive tech stack including frontend frameworks, backend technologies, and AI/ML capabilities.\n\n## 2.

The team identified duplicate repositories: plugin-n8n-workflow and plugin-n8n, requiring consolidation to avoid redundancy.\n\n**Technical Issues Identified:**\nOdilitime encountered build errors when attempting to use plugin-n8n-workflow, specifically TypeScript errors related to missing JSON module declarations for `defaultNodes.json`, `schemaIndex.json`, and `triggerSchemaIndex.json`.\n\n**Solution Provided:**\nStan explained that the JSON data files are intentionally excluded from the Git repository and must be generated dynamically. The 'crawl' script must be executed locally to generate these files. In production, this generation occurs at the CI level during the release process.\n\n**Plugin Comparison and Decision:**\nStan advocated for using his plugin-n8n-workflow as the primary solution, citing superior features including: auto-correction for inputs/outputs based on extensive data, a drafting phase with workflow preview showing missing clarifications, automatic OAuth handling, zero hallucination with only OAuth-supported nodes, dual modes (manual and integrated DB for credential storage), and cloud integration without vendor lock-in. Stan noted the existing plugin-n8n lacks these comprehensive features and recommended using his plugin as-is to avoid introducing errors through modifications.\n\n**Version Management:**\nOdilitime discussed managing 1.x and 2.x plugin versions, consolidating cskills into the 1.x branch of plugin-agent-skills. Plans include creating a tool to push 1.x updates to 2.x while stopping backports to encourage 2.x adoption. Odilitime maintains 6 projects on 1.x and needs to port all 1.x plugins to 2.x while ensuring 2.x plugins maintain quality parity.\n\n**Infrastructure Update:**\nStan announced a dedicated n8n service account with updated API keys to be distributed for environment configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can we consolidate plugin-n8n-workflow with plugin-n8n? (asked by s) A: Yes, consolidation is needed by deleting one repository (answered by s)\n\nQ: Why won't plugin-n8n-workflow build with missing JSON module errors? (asked by Odilitime) A: The JSON data files must be generated by running the 'crawl' script locally; they're not in Git and are generated dynamically during CI release process (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Which n8n plugin should be used as the primary solution? (asked by s) A: Stan's plugin-n8n-workflow is more comprehensive with auto-correction, OAuth handling, workflow preview, and zero hallucination features (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\n## 3.
