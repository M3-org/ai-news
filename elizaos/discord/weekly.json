The single message is a personal historical anecdote from DorianD about their great grandfather's experience with currency devaluation during migration from the Russian empire to Poland. The story describes how hyperinflation reduced the value of money from selling a house to only being able to purchase a sofa during a one-month journey to Krakow, though some wealth was preserved in a Swiss bank account denominated in gold. This appears to be a conversational tangent unrelated to any technical partnership discussions, development work, or project-related matters.\n\n## 2.

Key technical problems included plugin integration bugs that s acknowledged, with wallet fixes being resolved locally. A critical issue emerged regarding `MAX_EMBEDDING_TOKENS` missing from latest plugin versions - Wes proposed either using older plugin versions or submitting PRs to add the constant to all plugin repos.\n\nCharacter configuration was a recurring problem. azsxdc struggled with the agent defaulting to \"eliza\" personality instead of custom characters, and experienced model selection issues where claude-haiku-3.5 was used despite different configuration. Bill Ding announced he was implementing a character editor that day to address these issues. Currently, character creation is limited to onboarding setup only.\n\nTwitter plugin functionality had limitations - quote repost feature doesn't work properly, only posting quoted text with a link instead of native quote tweets. The agent successfully connected and posted to Twitter but lacked proper character customization.\n\nMochinoLabs proposed a significant architectural change: integrating PM2 as an external process manager for websocket management, suggesting a new directory structure using symlinks for better git-managed workflows. The proposed structure includes separate config directories for OpenClaw gateway, PM2 processes, and organized data/market directories.\n\nDeployment questions arose about VPS hosting versus local execution, and compatibility with elizaos examples. The community showed interest in testing, with ElBru planning to use milaidy setup as a homeschool project for his 10-year-old son, aligning with the project's accessibility goals.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Would milaidy support the examples from elizaos? Or do we need to run both Eliza and milaidy for full functionality? (asked by azsxdc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did anyone put milaidy on a vps? or running it locally only? (asked by azsxdc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I submit PRs to all plugin repos to add MAX_EMBEDDING_TOKENS to the latest or what direction should we go? (asked by Wes) A: Unanswered (s said \"let him cook\" suggesting Wes should proceed)\n\nQ: Where should I put the character files? It keeps defaulting to eliza (asked by azsxdc) A: There isn't a way other than the one you make in the onboarding (answered by Bill Ding)\n\nQ: Does Twitter plugin not allow quote reposts? (asked by azsxdc) A: No idea, you're welcome to make an issue or attempt to fix yourself (answered by Bill Ding)\n\nQ: Can you help me with the guide to add a new character for the agent? (asked by azsxdc) A: There isn't a way other than the one you make in the onboarding (answered by Bill Ding)\n\nQ: What is cluster mode? (asked by MochinoLabs) A: Unanswered (Odilitime asked this in response to PM2 suggestion)\n\n## 3.

The primary technical discussion centered on the logs table causing significant performance degradation in PostgreSQL, which directly impacts Eliza response times. Sayonara identified this bottleneck, noting that the logs table is being hit excessively, creating a cascading slowdown effect on the entire system.\n\nStan acknowledged the issue and confirmed that a major optimization plan is already in development to address this database performance problem. This indicates the team is aware of the scalability challenges and has prioritized optimization work.\n\nA secondary discussion involved clarification about the Milaidy product branding, with Kenk noting a discrepancy between the URL and product name ('milaidy' vs 'milady.ai'), though this was a minor observational point rather than a technical issue requiring immediate resolution.\n\nThe conversation demonstrates active monitoring of production performance issues and proactive planning for infrastructure improvements, which are critical for maintaining system reliability as usage scales.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment reveals significant community frustration with the ELIZAOS token project rather than technical discussions. The primary concerns centered around token price decline (reported at $0.0013), lack of communication from the development team, and perceived mismanagement.\n\nKey developments mentioned include: escrow payment implementation for agent rentals (shared by M I A M I), and upcoming delistings from three Korean exchanges scheduled for 3:00 PM KST. The community raised critical questions about staking availability (confirmed unavailable by Arceon), token use-cases, and the status of five products promised months ago that remain undelivered.\n\nCommunity sentiment was predominantly negative, with holders expressing concerns about: continuous daily price drops exceeding 5%, key developers reportedly leaving the team, lack of marketing strategy, and poor community management practices including alleged muting/banning of critical voices. Some members speculated about potential token migration plans for March.\n\nLimited positive signals included mention of upcoming launches, a planned bullish video from \"crypto gains\" investor, and high traffic to ai.com causing website crashes. One developer (bigzee) posted availability for full-stack and AI development work with expertise in React, Node.js, Python, AI/ML frameworks, and various databases.\n\nThe overarching theme was community dissatisfaction with team transparency and accountability, with multiple users questioning the project's viability and requesting concrete updates on product development and token utility.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there any places to stake $ELIZAOS? (asked by mbat) A: No at the moment there is no staking (answered by Arceon)\n\nQ: Will team launch any token use-case or product which may use ElizaOS token?

Summary\n\nThe discussion channel was dominated by community concerns about token price decline, exchange delistings, and perceived lack of team communication. The primary technical issue discussed was the Korean exchange delisting situation - there was significant confusion about whether ELIZAOS was being delisted from Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit. User gby claimed the delisting was confirmed and scheduled, while davidhq and paolin later clarified that only the pre-rebrand AI16Z token was delisted, not the current ELIZAOS token.\n\nA critical migration issue emerged when user ufw discovered they had missed the ai16z to ELIZA token migration deadline, asking if their tokens were lost. This question went unanswered by team members.\n\nTechnical development updates were minimal but included: jin posting a weekly roundup video of ElizaOS updates, yojo providing feedback on elizacloud.ai UX optimization needs (suggesting prompt-only user features, visual generation optimization, plug-in marketplace, and crypto transfers without wallet connect), and Seppmos sharing a video covering Babylon and Hyperscape developments.\n\nCommunity sentiment was largely negative, with multiple users (averma, gby, Gem Hunter) expressing concerns about: lack of token utility, team selling tokens (specifically Shaw's wallet DScqtGwFoDTme2Rzdjpdb2w7CtuKc6Z8KF7hMhbx8ugQ being monitored), developers leaving the project (CJ and another unnamed dev), and absence of admin/team presence in the channel. User ovo defended the team, noting Shaw covered unexpected costs to recover the X account and that the team burned 22M tokens. The discussion revealed deep frustration from token holders who felt the open-source development work wasn't translating to token value or holder benefits.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where can I bridge eliza token from solana to bsc? (asked by clutch) A: There is currently NO official or safe bridge for Eliza from Solana to BSC (answered by EMERSON3S)\n\nQ: Is $ELIZAOS going to be delisted from the 3 korean exchanges? (asked by avi_rajput563 | TABI 💢) A: Conflicting responses - gby claimed delisting was confirmed and scheduled in 2 hours on Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit; davidhq and paolin later clarified only pre-rebrand AI16Z was delisted, not current ELIZAOS (answered by EMERSON3S initially saying \"ignore the lies\", then gby, davidhq, and paolin)\n\nQ: What happens if I didn't migrate my original a16z tokens in time?

The assistant features user-selectable voices and customizable themes/avatars, including the classic Eliza model.\n\nYojo proposed a comprehensive product improvement idea for Eliza/ElizaCloud.ai focused on implementing in-dashboard weekly updates and roadmap communications. The proposal emphasized improving user retention through transparent communication about achievements, bug fixes, and objectives directly within user account dashboards. The suggestion included integration of ElizaOS token purchasing/holding functionality within accounts to support decentralization and potentially impact market capitalization positively.\n\nA community question about staking on a new domain was quickly resolved by EMERSON3S confirming no staking portal currently exists.\n\nMultiple developers posted availability messages seeking opportunities, including Callie, bigzee (Full-Stack & AI Developer with React, Node.js, Python, AI/ML experience), and aicodeflow (8 years AI and Automation engineering experience). Satsbased actively recruited coders for an agentic payment app team.\n\nThe technical stack mentioned included frontend technologies (React, Next.js, Angular, Vue, React Native), backend (Node.js, Express, Python with FastAPI/Flask), AI/ML tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow, LLMs, LangChain, RAG), and infrastructure (VectorDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, AWS).\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main themes: token migration concerns, communication/transparency issues, and technical comparisons with competitors.\n\n**Token Migration & Project Status:**\nThe ElizaOS token migration was confirmed complete by Odilitime. Community members expressed frustration about price decline and questioned whether the token has utility beyond being a meme coin. Thau provided a comprehensive response clarifying that the project is actively developed (framework, agents, ElizaCloud, cross-chain work) and that price action doesn't indicate a rug pull. The core issue identified was signal-to-noise ratio and communication clarity rather than project viability.\n\n**Communication & Roadmap Concerns:**\nBiazs raised significant concerns about irregular updates and lack of weekly communication, noting that month-long breaks hurt the project amid daily rugpull FUD on X. Kenk responded by pointing to existing roadmap and update channels, stating updates occur when key milestones are reached. The debate highlighted tension between community desire for regular scheduled updates versus milestone-based communication. Yojo suggested implementing automated AI agent-based communication systems for different channels (user dashboards, Discord, Twitter) with tailored PAR format (Problem-Action-Solution) updates, proposing this could become a B2B product itself.\n\n**Technical Discussions:**\nDorianD compared ElizaOS unfavorably with OpenClaw, noting OpenClaw's simpler setup (4-minute wizard for WhatsApp/Telegram integration), system command toggles, and better user experience. Specific gaps identified: WhatsApp integration requested a year ago, ability to run system commands, and startup simplicity. Wes acknowledged ElizaOS was ahead of its time as agent worlds proliferate. Competition noted includes Shizuku (a16z-funded AI companion project) and concerns about losing mindshare to \"AI slop projects.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the ElizaOS token migration over? (asked by Zoking_b) A: Yes it is (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does the Eliza coin currently have utility features, or is it just a meme coin? (asked by Zoking_b) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is Babylon going to be released soon? (asked by g) A: Babylon has been in \"will release in a couple of weeks\" state for like 4 months (answered by Biazs)\n\nQ: Where can I find the roadmap and updates? (asked by Biazs) A: Roadmap is available in linked Discord channel, updates in announcements channel, and Shaw updates via X whenever anything happens (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: How often will the roadmap be updated? (asked by Biazs) A: We will update against the roadmap when key milestones are reached (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

DorianD raised concerns about elizacloud's accessibility for openclaw agents, noting it needs \"minorish changes\" to enable automatic integration. The conversation revealed that elizacloud is actively maintained, with Odilitime confirming multiple people work on it and that it drives milaidy and other projects.\n\nA significant development emerged around **Twitter plugin integration**. azsxdc announced they're using Eliza's Twitter plugin on Openclaw (rather than Openclaw's native Twitter implementation) because Eliza's implementation is superior and avoids ban-risk methods. They committed to sharing this fork on GitHub.\n\nThe most substantial technical discussion involved **agent authentication for elizacloud**. DorianD proposed implementing a proof-of-agent system where agents demonstrate capability through coding tasks, followed by 8004 registration. They explored using SIWA (Sign In With Apple) signatures via Privy for agent authentication. Odilitime responded by committing to implement **SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum, EIP 4361)** for elizacloud, having just completed SIWE implementation for babylon. The goal is to enable agents to easily generate API keys for elizacloud access.\n\nDorianD also discussed potential business model improvements, suggesting elizacloud could support 100k+ paying users by simplifying agent access through task-based token earning systems. They questioned the utility of the llms.txt endpoint when actual CLI/API access remains difficult for agents.\n\nElizaBAO announced receiving a **Solana grant**, though details weren't elaborated. Odilitime mentioned recent cloud API improvements with plans to update LLM functionality next, and noted ongoing collaboration with Privy on new features that may significantly change current implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there no one working on elizacloud anymore? (asked by DorianD) A: Several people are working on it, it drives milaidy and more (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is this the web dashboard for it? (asked by kira) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: When you guys did that deal with X does it allow you to function as like a sort of api aggregator for agents? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can you assign rate limits within total capacity for various api calls? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What is SIWA? (asked by DorianD) A: SIWA is Apple, EIP 4361 is SIWE (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are you saying having agent sign up for elizacloud? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, using signature to authenticate the agent (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical areas: token migration issues, ElizaCloud.ai platform feedback, and platform architecture questions.\n\n**Token Migration**: Multiple users reported missing the AI16z to ElizaOS migration window. kwi_viet opened ticket-0550 for manual migration and was waiting over a week for response. Concerns were raised about a personal wallet address (77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5) being used for migration, though Odilitime confirmed this was legitimate.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Platform Issues**: yojo provided extensive market research feedback from 5 potential non-coding investors who tested the platform. Key problems identified: welcome bonus issues, billing/payment problems (especially with VPN), difficulty finding reliable plugins, unclear target audience (coders vs non-coders), and poor UX for adding USD to accounts. Double account creation bug for single email with $5 welcome bonus remained unresolved. Odilitime extracted action items: clarify concrete objectives, define cloud audience, make roadmap more discoverable, improve USD addition process, expand plugin ecosystem, and consider beta labeling.\n\n**Technical Solutions Discussed**: Odilitime confirmed ElizaOS has a public roadmap at github.com/elizaos/roadmap and crypto payment options are on the roadmap. For the heartbeat/openclaw equivalent question from Bulldozer, Odilitime confirmed ElizaOS has \"tasks\" (cron equivalent) and a plugin that uses agent skills.\n\n**Trading/Slippage**: Arkantos sought OTC token purchase to avoid slippage. Omid Sa recommended PancakeSwap on BSC for minimum slippage, while Rainman suggested orca.so CEX on Solana.\n\nThe conversation revealed tension between rapid growth expectations and platform maturity, with Odilitime defending development progress while acknowledging the need for UX improvements.\n\n## 2.

This method provides extensive freedom but was critiqued by Odilitime as being \"heavy\" and overly reliant on HTTP.\n\nThe conversation pivoted to HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets as an alternative solution. Both participants agreed HD wallets offer a simpler, more flexible approach that provides appropriate control levels without the overhead of the OAuth/Privy method. dEXploarer noted HD wallets would work well whether agents are signing up subagents or managing users, with the key advantage being the ability to branch wallets down hierarchically.\n\ndEXploarer also announced work on a token project (LunchTable TCG) and requested collaboration help, specifically mentioning that streaming functionality is already operational but UI/UX overhaul and artwork integration are in progress.

The team identified duplicate repositories: plugin-n8n-workflow and plugin-n8n, requiring consolidation to avoid redundancy.\n\n**Technical Issues Identified:**\nOdilitime encountered build errors when attempting to use plugin-n8n-workflow, specifically TypeScript errors related to missing JSON module declarations for `defaultNodes.json`, `schemaIndex.json`, and `triggerSchemaIndex.json`.\n\n**Solution Provided:**\nStan explained that the JSON data files are intentionally excluded from the Git repository and must be generated dynamically. The 'crawl' script must be executed locally to generate these files. In production, this generation occurs at the CI level during the release process.\n\n**Plugin Comparison and Decision:**\nStan advocated for using his plugin-n8n-workflow as the primary solution, citing superior features including: auto-correction for inputs/outputs based on extensive data, a drafting phase with workflow preview showing missing clarifications, automatic OAuth handling, zero hallucination with only OAuth-supported nodes, dual modes (manual and integrated DB for credential storage), and cloud integration without vendor lock-in. Stan noted the existing plugin-n8n lacks these comprehensive features and recommended using his plugin as-is to avoid introducing errors through modifications.\n\n**Version Management:**\nOdilitime discussed managing 1.x and 2.x plugin versions, consolidating cskills into the 1.x branch of plugin-agent-skills. Plans include creating a tool to push 1.x updates to 2.x while stopping backports to encourage 2.x adoption. Odilitime maintains 6 projects on 1.x and needs to port all 1.x plugins to 2.x while ensuring 2.x plugins maintain quality parity.\n\n**Infrastructure Update:**\nStan announced a dedicated n8n service account with updated API keys to be distributed for environment configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can we consolidate plugin-n8n-workflow with plugin-n8n?

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several key technical challenges and community feedback regarding ElizaOS development.\n\n**Moltbook Verification Challenge**: The most significant technical discussion involved funboy implementing a solution for Moltbook's anti-bot verification system. The platform requires agents to solve obfuscated math problems within 30 seconds, with penalties for failures (1-day suspension for first error, 7-day for second, history deletion for third). Funboy successfully implemented a verification solver using DeepSeek-chat model that intercepts verification_required responses, extracts the challenge, solves the math problem, and POSTs the answer back to the verify endpoint. The solution achieved successful verification with proper formatting (e.g., \"25.00\" for \"32-7\").\n\n**Security Concerns**: A discussion emerged about potential vulnerabilities where malicious actors could inject \"fake memories\" into ElizaOS agents' long-term storage. Odilitime clarified this is an LLM vulnerability, not specific to ElizaOS, noting the fundamental challenge of distinguishing fake from real memories.\n\n**Platform Usability Feedback**: Extensive feedback was provided by yojo regarding ElizaOS's target audience clarity. Key concerns included: when zero-coding agent creation will be available for non-technical users, unclear token utility and governance plans, missing roadmap milestones (e.g., ElizaOS token payment integration), and roadmap presentation format. The discussion highlighted that currently, without plugins and technical knowledge, ElizaOS offers limited advantages over centralized AI like ChatGPT, with the main differentiator being decentralized data ownership.\n\n**Community Onboarding**: Multiple users discussed practical usage, with Rainman seeking guidance on how non-technical users can leverage ElizaOS and how to present it to a 300+ investor community. The consensus was that full potential requires technical implementation and plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How are you handling verification_required challenge on Moltbook? (asked by funboy) A: Intercept JSON with verification data, send to LLM solver outside character loop, POST result to verify endpoint; successfully implemented using DeepSeek-chat model (answered by funboy)\n\nQ: Is the fake memory injection vulnerability a real risk for ElizaOS? (asked by yojo) A: It's an LLM vulnerability, not ElizaOS-specific; fundamentally difficult to distinguish fake from real memories (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How can I start using ElizaOS to improve my life as a non-tech guy? (asked by Rainman) A: Register on elizacloud.ai, create personal agent with prompts, but without plugins and technical knowledge, reasonable use cases can't be fully implemented (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: How can ElizaAI be different or better than ChatGPT? (asked by Rainman) A: With full tech & plugins: proactive multi-task management, synced operations; without plugins: main difference is decentralized vs centralized AI ownership (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: How would I best present ElizaOS to 300+ investors in a few sentences? (asked by Rainman) A: High-performance potential with low market cap, modular architecture, web3-native crosschain integration, first-mover in decentralized AI-agent framework, TypeScript safety; check GitHub roadmap (answered by yojo)\n\nQ: What model did you use for Moltbook verification? (asked by Odilitime) A: DeepSeek-chat (answered by funboy)\n\nQ: Can I open a ticket for migration support? (asked by fragmtagmbagm) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The discussion centered around two users (s and Odilitime) requesting credits to be added to their cloud accounts. Stan provided the technical solution, indicating that credits can be added via an UPDATE operation in the user database. \n\nThe interaction revealed the account lookup process: Stan initially attempted to locate Odilitime's account using the provided email address (odi@elizalabs.ai) but couldn't find it in either production or preview environments. Odilitime clarified that the account was created using Google authentication and provided additional identifying information including the organization slug (odi-tngt6p0bp7) and Account ID (19fc31b7-c337-4024-894e-44a7d72a9602). Using this information, Stan successfully located the account and added 1000 credits.\n\nThe technical takeaway is that the platform's user database supports direct credit manipulation through UPDATE queries, and accounts created via OAuth providers like Google may not be immediately searchable by email alone, requiring alternative identifiers such as organization slug or Account ID for lookup.\n\n## 2.
