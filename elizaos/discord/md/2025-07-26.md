# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform & Community Status
- **X (Twitter) Ban Resolution**: ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z are currently banned from X. Kenk reported that "a resolution with X is in sight" and communication between teams has improved. The team is holding off on creating new accounts while working toward this resolution.
- **Ecosystem Support**: Discussion about the Solana ecosystem's relative silence regarding ElizaOS's situation. Kenk noted that while Solana has featured them in hackathons, broader ecosystem support has been limited, though Superteam has supported them at builder events and incubators.
- **Chain Strategy**: Kenk clarified that while ElizaOS is Solana-native from a token perspective, they are chain-agnostic.

### Technical Discussions
- **Eliza Model Capabilities**: Shaw clarified that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses. Websocket functionality allows sending messages outside the standard response pattern.
- **JSON Formatting Issues**: A user reported problems with Eliza's JSON response format, specifically with single quote handling causing display problems in their extension.
- **Transaction Failures**: A user experienced a transaction failure due to instruction deserialization errors in the auto.fun launchpad.

### Community Activities
- **Meme Creation**: Several users discussed creating memes and promotional content for the Eliza project and related tokens using Midjourney.
- **Token Discussion**: Community members discussed cryptocurrency tokens (particularly "Eli5" and "Eddy") and price predictions.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news and updates about ElizaOS?**  
A (Kenk): Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For now, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight and are holding off on starting new accounts.

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A (Kenk): We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams.

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem?**  
A (Kenk): The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst.

**Q: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default?**  
A (Shaw): No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response.

**Q: What tools do you use for this [image creation]?**  
A (Dr. Neuro): Midjourney
