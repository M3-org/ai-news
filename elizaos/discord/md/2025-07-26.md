## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which X accounts should we follow for ElizaOS updates?**  
A: Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. The team has a resolution with X in sight. (Kenk)

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (Kenk)

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default? Do we need custom orchestration for multiple responses?**  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (Shaw)

**Q: How can we fix Eliza's JSON response format hallucinations?**  
A: Try a larger model. And if you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI. (Starlord)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaOS ecosystem?**  
A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical, ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (Kenk)

**Q: What tools do you use for image creation?**  
A: Midjourney (Dr. Neuro)
