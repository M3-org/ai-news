# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Status & Community Updates
- **X (Twitter) Account Bans**: ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z remain banned from X, but Kenk mentioned "a resolution with X in sight" and faster communication between teams
- **Team Visibility**: Kenk shared a comprehensive list of team members to follow for project updates while the main accounts remain banned
- **Ecosystem Position**: While Solana has featured ElizaOS in hackathons, the team clarified they are "chain agnostic" despite having a Solana-native token

### Technical Developments
- **AI Provider Consolidation**: Shaw proposed creating a unified `plugin-inference` that would support multiple API-compatible services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq)
- **Dynamic Plugin Architecture**: Discussion about the most scalable approach for switching between AI providers, with options including dynamic loading/unloading of plugins
- **TEE Deployment**: Agent Joshua is working on Trusted Execution Environment deployment and offered to create a vanilla elizaOS template for cloud launching
- **Knowledge Management**: R0am demonstrated a personal agent built with n8n and Zep that processes data from Readwise, Brave search API, and websites to build a knowledge graph

### Technical Challenges
- **JSON Response Format Issues**: Users reported problems with Eliza hallucinating and modifying single quotes in JSON responses
- **Transaction Failures**: A user reported "Transaction failed due to instruction deserialization error" in the auto.fun launchpad
- **Crosschain Solutions**: Discussion about lock-and-mint synthetic bridges for potential token implementation, with Shaw noting "we can't lock our tokens"

### Community Content Creation
- **Meme Development**: Several users discussed creating promotional content using Midjourney, with Dr. Neuro offering to help others learn image/GIF/video creation
- **Token Discussion**: Community members speculated about price targets for tokens like "Eli5" and "Eddy"

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?**  
A (shaw): No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response.

**Q: Which X accounts should we follow for ElizaOS updates?**  
A (Kenk): Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For the time being, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight.

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A (Kenk): We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams.

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem?**  
A (Kenk): The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst.

**Q: What if we could make a plugin-inference that supports multiple API-compatible services?**  
A (Odilitime): It would be the most scalable approach but requires solving plugin loading/unloading issues.

**Q: How would you prioritize which service to use if you had multiple API keys set?**  
A (shaw): You could dynamically load/unload plugins, swap plugin event order, or put everything in one plugin and swap model names.

**Q: When looking at crosschain solutions, did you look into lock-and-mint synthetic bridges?**  
A (shaw): We can't lock our tokens.
