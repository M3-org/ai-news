# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### X Platform Ban Resolution
- ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z accounts have been banned from X (formerly Twitter)
- Team has "a resolution with X in sight" and is holding off on creating new accounts
- Communication between ElizaOS and X teams has become quicker
- Team is not sharing screenshots of communications with X

### Technical Capabilities of Eliza
- Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses
- Websockets functionality allows messages to be sent outside the standard response pattern
- The platform is Solana-native from a token perspective but is chain-agnostic

### Ecosystem Development
- Opportunities for agents on-chain are broad and diverse across different verticals
- Solana has featured ElizaOS in hackathons
- Superteam has supported ElizaOS at builder events and incubators
- Community members are creating promotional content including memes and images

### Technical Issues
- JSON response format issues where Eliza is hallucinating and modifying single quotes
- Transaction failure error related to "instruction deserialization" in the auto.fun launchpad

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news and updates about ElizaOS?**  
A (Kenk): Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For the time being, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight.

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A (Kenk): We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams.

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaOS ecosystem?**  
A (Kenk): The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst.

**Q: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default?**  
A (shaw): No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response.

**Q: How can we fix Eliza's response format when she's hallucinating and not respecting our specific JSON format?**  
A (starlord): Try a larger model. If you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI.

**Q: What tools do you use for image creation?**  
A (Dr. Neuro): Midjourney
