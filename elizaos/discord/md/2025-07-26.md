## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which X accounts should I follow for ElizaOS updates?**  
A: Follow the team members' accounts as listed, as they're holding off on creating new accounts while resolving issues with X. (Kenk)

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (Kenk)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaOS ecosystem?**  
A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical, ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (Kenk)

**Q: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default?**  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (Shaw)

**Q: How can we fix Eliza hallucinating and not respecting our required JSON format?**  
A: Try a larger model. If you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI. (Starlord)

**Q: What tools do you use for this?** (regarding meme creation)  
A: Midjourney (Dr. Neuro)
