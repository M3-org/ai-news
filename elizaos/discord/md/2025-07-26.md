# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform & Community Status
- **X (Twitter) Ban Situation**: ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z remain banned from X, but Kenk reported "a resolution with X in sight" and improved communication between teams
- **Ecosystem Position**: While Solana has featured ElizaOS in hackathons, the team describes themselves as "chain agnostic" despite having a Solana-native token
- **GENIUS Act**: The passing of this legislation was mentioned as potentially impacting memecoin regulation

### Technical Architecture
- **AI Provider Consolidation**: Discussion about consolidating multiple AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq) into a single `plugin-inference` approach
- **Plugin Architecture**: Debate on the best approach for handling multiple AI providers, with consensus favoring dynamic loading/unloading of plugins as the most scalable solution
- **Eliza Capabilities**: Clarification that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses, and can use websockets to send messages outside standard response patterns

### Agent Development
- **Knowledge Management**: R0am demonstrated a personal agent built with n8n and Zep that processes data from Readwise highlights, Brave search API, and web content
- **Deployment Solutions**: Agent Joshua is working on TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) deployment and offered to create a vanilla elizaOS template for cloud launching
- **JSON Formatting Issues**: Users reported problems with Eliza hallucinating and modifying single quotes in JSON responses, causing display problems

### Blockchain Integration
- **Transaction Failures**: Reports of errors related to "instruction deserialization" in the auto.fun launchpad
- **Crosschain Solutions**: Discussion about lock-and-mint synthetic bridges for token functionality
- **Token Ecosystem**: Mentions of "Eli5" token and efforts to get it listed on CoinGecko

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default? We need to build custom orchestration patterns if we want the agent to deliver multiple responses?**  
A (shaw): No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message *not* as a response.

**Q: How would you prioritize which provider to use if you had multiple keys set?**  
A (shaw): The order informs which one is the model and which is the embeddings; dynamic loading/unloading of plugins would be the most scalable solution.

**Q: What if we could make a plugin-inference that supports multiple AI providers?**  
A (cjft): It would be better to use ai-sdk which has already standardized this work.

**Q: How can we fix Eliza's response format when she's hallucinating and not respecting the correct JSON format?**  
A (starlord): Try a larger model. And if you can't, buy a cloud GPU or use OpenAI.

**Q: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news about ElizaOS?**  
A (Kenk): Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. [Provided comprehensive list]

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A (Kenk): We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams.

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem?**  
A (Kenk): The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical, ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Deployment Guide Assistance**
   - Agent Joshua offered to create a vanilla elizaOS template for cloud launching with deployment instructions after "putting his babies to bed"
   - Sayonara noted high demand for deployment guides

2. **Knowledge Graph Implementation**
   - R0am shared screenshots and explained his setup using Readwise, Brave search API, and Zep for agent memory
   - Demonstrated how his personal agent processes data and understands conversations

3. **Image Creation Support**
   - Dr. Neuro created sample images using Midjourney for the "Eliza" project
   - Offered to teach others how to create images, GIFs, and videos, explaining the process "like you're five"

4. **JSON Formatting Issues**
   - Samuel Chauche reported problems with Eliza's JSON response format
   - Starlord suggested using a larger model or cloud GPU to address hallucination issues

5. **Channel Access**
   - Shaw gave Snapper the core-devs role to access restricted chat
