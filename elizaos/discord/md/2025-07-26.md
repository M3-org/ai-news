## Overall Discussion Highlights

### X Platform Ban Situation
- ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z have been banned from X (formerly Twitter)
- Kenk mentioned they have "a resolution with X in sight" and are holding off on creating new accounts
- Communication between ElizaOS and X teams has reportedly become quicker
- The team is not sharing screenshots of communications with X for confidentiality reasons

### Technical Capabilities & Issues
- Clarification that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses
- Websockets functionality allows messages to be sent outside the standard response pattern
- Users reported JSON response format issues where Eliza is hallucinating and modifying single quotes
- Transaction failures related to "instruction deserialization" in the auto.fun launchpad were reported
- Recommendation to use larger models to avoid hallucination issues when running locally

### Ecosystem & Community
- Discussion about the Solana ecosystem's relative silence regarding ElizaOS's situation
- Kenk noted that while ElizaOS is Solana-native from a token perspective, they are chain-agnostic
- Potential catalysts for the ElizaOS ecosystem include opportunities for agents on-chain across different verticals
- Community members are creating memes and visual content for projects using Midjourney
- Brief mentions of getting tokens (particularly "Eli5" and "Eddy") listed on CoinGecko

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news and updates about ElizaOS?**  
A: Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For the time being, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaOS ecosystem?**  
A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default?**  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)

**Q: What tools do you use for this [image creation]?**  
A: Midjourney (answered by Dr. Neuro)
