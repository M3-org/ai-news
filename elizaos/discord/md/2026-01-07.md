# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Critical Bug Fixes and Version 1.7.0 Issues

The development team identified and addressed critical compatibility issues with ElizaOS version 1.7.0. **Odilitime** discovered that the 1.7.0 core release had incomplete fixes affecting the bootstrap plugin's actions and providers, causing compatibility problems with plugin-discord 1.3.3. The primary symptom was a "No server ID found 10" error related to incomplete serverId to messageServerId migration in the codebase.

An urgent release was planned (PR #6333) to address these issues, though additional testing across multiple Discord branches was required before cutting a new Discord release. **Odilitime** created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches for the bootstrap plugin compatibility issues and recommended users either downgrade to core version 1.6.5 or wait for the fixes to be tested and merged.

### Discord Bot Integration Troubleshooting

**DigitalDiva** experienced significant issues getting their Discord bot to recognize server IDs and respond properly. The bot was throwing errors despite being given admin privileges. The troubleshooting process involved multiple community members:

- **Shaw** suggested creating a minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate whether the issue stemmed from Discord portal permissions or code-related problems, noting that Discord developer portal permission configuration is a common source of errors
- **Casino** recommended limiting bot permissions and incrementally adding features back to isolate the problem
- **Odilitime** diagnosed the root cause as the serverId migration issue in version 1.7.0 and provided the fix branch solution

### Architectural Decisions for Scaling

A significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways and scaling strategies. **Odilitime** outlined the direction forward:

- Simple event pumps as the preferred approach
- Multiple daemon instances per service will be needed due to scale requirements
- Different requirements for voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority event pumps) versus text connections
- Preprocessing identified as a valuable optimization strategy
- Recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing **Shaw's** preferred Discord bridge implementation

**Stan** provided updates on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, plus runtime initialization optimizations.

### Documentation and Community Resources

**Jin** shared valuable resources including:
- GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation
- ElizaOS book documentation link on HackMD, confirming workspace availability

**Stan** submitted documentation for review on HackMD alongside plugin PRs for Telegram (#22) and Discord (#41).

### Token and Contract Address Visibility

Community members raised concerns about the discoverability of the ElizaOS contract address (CA). Multiple users noted difficulty finding the official CA on X/Twitter accounts. **Broccolex** and others flagged that the current discoverability flow doesn't work well for most users. **Kenk** mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information, and **Shaw** confirmed the team would address posting the CA across official X accounts.

### API Integration Issues

**ElizaBAO** encountered a "Model not found" error when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints. **cjft** provided the solution by explaining the correct format for the model parameter: using provider prefixes in the format `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What version of ElizaOS are you using?** (asked by Odilitime)  
A: Version 1.7.0 with plugin-discord 1.3.3 (answered by DigitalDiva)

**Q: Does that mean I can keep this version?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  
A: You could try cloning the odi-17 branch which should work with plugin-discord 1.3.3, but still testing (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?** (asked by ElizaBAO)  
A: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)

**Q: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts?** (asked by degenwtf)  
A: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)

**Q: If I buy $ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?** (asked by nancy)  
A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)

**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd?** (asked by Stan ⚡)  
A: Yes (answered by jin, shared https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book)

**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?** (asked by Stan ⚡)  
A: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Why does the agent need admin privileges?** (asked by Odilitime)  
A: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)

**Q: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in made by elizaos?** (asked by ElizaBAO)  
A: Nope (answered by degenwtf)
