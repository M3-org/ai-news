# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Critical Discord Plugin Issues & Fixes

The Discord integration experienced significant breaking changes in ElizaOS v1.7.0, causing widespread "No server ID found" errors. **Odilitime** identified the root cause as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase. The core-devs team merged a critical bug fix (PR #6333), though compatibility issues persisted with Discord 1.3.3, requiring testing across multiple Discord branches and a new Discord release.

**DigitalDiva** encountered the error despite correct intent configurations and admin permissions, with error logs showing the bot couldn't detect server ID, username, or server owner. **Odilitime** created the odi-17 branch with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers and recommended either downgrading to core v1.6.5 or using the custom branch. **Shaw** suggested debugging with a minimal Discord.js hello world script to isolate permission issues from the Discord developer portal, while **Casino** recommended limiting scope/permissions and working back to desired features.

### Performance Optimizations & Architecture

**Stan** identified multiple latency improvements for the monorepo and prepared comprehensive documentation on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a "deduct-before, reconcile-after" approach. He also worked on runtime initialization optimizations and submitted PRs for Telegram and Discord plugins.

Architecture discussions in core-devs focused on connector gateways and event pumps. The team discussed scaling strategies, noting that voice connections would require higher priority/bandwidth event pumps compared to text, with preprocessing expected to provide significant benefits. The consensus leaned toward simple event pump architecture with plans for multiple daemon instances per service. **Odilitime** recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation.

### New Contributor Onboarding

**aicodeflow** introduced themselves as a blockchain + AI engineer interested in contributing to ElizaOS, specifically around:
- Agent autonomy with constraints
- Onchain execution layers with explicit guardrails
- Prediction market templates
- Observability tooling for inspectable agent decisions

They offered expertise in cleaning up embedding delegation, redesigning plugins as "skills" rather than integrations, and building market-aware agents focused on interpretation/state rather than execution. **Odilitime** directed them to the Spartan project (github.com/elizaos/spartan), a DeFi utilities initiative, and recommended starting with plugin-based development through elizaos-plugins repositories. **Kenk** mentioned upcoming open sessions for new contributors.

### Database Migration & Development Workflow

**Andrei Mitrea** faced a database migration issue when running `elizaos start` a second time. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like "agent_id" and "room_id" from the worlds table. **! "Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇"** provided the solution: set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development. **Omid Sa** additionally suggested using `elizaos dev` for continuous monitoring during development.

### API Integration & Model Configuration

**ElizaBAO** encountered a "Model not found" error when integrating ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. **cjft** resolved this by explaining the correct model parameter format requires provider prefixes:
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`

### Token Migration & Marketing Concerns

Multiple users asked about AI16Z to ElizaOS migration mechanics. **nancy** questioned the 120X calculation based on market cap differences. **Omid Sa** clarified that purchases after the November 11 snapshot aren't eligible for migration. 

**degenwtf** raised concerns about the ElizaOS contract address not being posted on official X accounts. **shaw** acknowledged this and committed to addressing it. **Broccolex** and **Kenk** debated best practices for CA visibility, with **Kenk** noting the linktree would point to CoinGecko.

### Project Updates

**meltingsnow** inquired about DegenAI updates, noting it seemed "pretty basic still." **satsbased** confirmed the new version hasn't shipped yet. **BingBongBing** expressed bullish sentiment on ElizaOS GitHub activity and mentioned DegenAI developments at 1M market cap.

**AlleyBoss** announced an updated library for x402 protocol integration with ElizaOS (`@alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`), offering a simplified implementation approach.

**jin** shared RSS feed URLs for ElizaOS documentation and suggested creating a combined dashboard with multiple data sources, along with a GitHub workflow reference for documentation updates from GitHub Next's agentics repository.

### Interesting Technical Findings

A finding from a Cursor call revealed that using your own Claude API key bypasses Cursor's optimized version with output improvements. Additionally, a minor content correction issue was discussed regarding incorrect information on the Eigenlayer website being propagated by LLMs.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why does the Discord plugin show "No server ID found" error?**  
A: This is because ElizaOS is moving from serverId to messageServerId, related to using develop branch (answered by **Odilitime**)

**Q: Should I downgrade to fix Discord plugin issues?**  
A: Might be easier to use an older core like 1.6.5, or try the odi-17 branch with fixes (answered by **Odilitime**)

**Q: How do I run elizaos start without getting destructive migration errors?**  
A: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting, or use elizaos dev command for continuous development monitoring (answered by **! "Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇"** and **Omid Sa**)

**Q: What format should I use for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?**  
A: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by **cjft**)

**Q: If I buy AI16Z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  
A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by **Omid Sa**)
