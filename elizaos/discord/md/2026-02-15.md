# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration Crisis

A significant portion of community discussion centered on the **ai16z to ElizaOS token migration deadline**, which officially closed on February 4th after a 90-day window. Multiple long-term holders (fibsonly, Andi CEGY, GomesCozendey) expressed frustration about missing the migration deadline, with some having held tokens since before the November 11 snapshot. Omid Sa confirmed that no further migration support is available after the official deadline, creating distress among affected community members. Andi CEGY advocated for a second migration opportunity or manual process for verified long-term holders with on-chain proof, though no official response was provided.

### Security and Scam Prevention

**Critical security concerns** emerged with multiple scam attempts targeting community members. Monsgroow reported scammer ID 364718078946312192 operating through the coders thread. Fragmtagmbagm was targeted through a fake support ticket in the coders thread after working with someone for 2 days. Odilitime provided crucial warnings that legitimate support never asks users to join other Discord servers or Zoom calls. The community identified the need to restrict thread creation access to prevent future scammer activity.

### Tokenomics and Market Challenges

A fundamental challenge was highlighted by DannyNOR NoFapArc: **the ElizaOS framework has no direct tie to the token**, creating zero inherent reason to buy it. This remains a major hurdle for the project. The market cap of $12 million prompted questions from Kvízákov about why meme coins achieve higher valuations. DorianD noted the loss of memetic power from moving away from the ai16z branding. Alexei mentioned potential solutions including buyback mechanisms using revenue from Eliza Cloud.

### Ecosystem Growth Strategy

DorianD outlined the strategic approach for ElizaOS ecosystem expansion: the base installation strategy aims to increase node installations to facilitate easier integration when token utility is implemented. A key technical recommendation emerged: **the base install should include system prompts making agents aware of ElizaCloud capabilities** and suggesting them as solution sets for both ElizaOS and the Milaidy fork. This would improve discoverability and integration of cloud features.

### Technical Development

0xConsole reported successful completion of an Openclaw adapter implementation, indicating progress on integration work. Einav Livne sought assistance with deploying the Spartan agent, with Odilitime offering help. Questions about staking availability were addressed, with Omid Sa confirming it would be available after the JEJU launch, though no specific timeline was provided.

### Community Engagement and Marketing

0xqueen shared Shaw's post about ElizaOS capabilities and offered to share seedance2.0 account access (with 60k images and 1,400 videos remaining) for creating promotional videos for Eliza or Milady. This represents an opportunity to improve marketing and community awareness of the project's capabilities.
