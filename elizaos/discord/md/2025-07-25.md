## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I create an agent for my Discord channel?** (asked by 3on_)  
A: Use Cursor AI to help with installation, fork the main repo in GitHub, git clone it locally, and configure settings to index files for better functionality. (answered by DorianD)

**Q: What's the status with X/Twitter accounts?** (asked by Gianni)  
A: We have a resolution with X in sight and communications have become quicker between teams. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Which X accounts should I follow for ElizaOS updates?** (asked by Hannes K.)  
A: Follow the team members listed, as they're holding off on starting new accounts while resolving issues with X. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst for the ElizaOS ecosystem?** (asked by CULTVESTING)  
A: Breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst, with opportunities ranging from IP to Content Creators. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?** (asked by Snapper)  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)

**Q: Which embedding provider is best for plugin-knowledge?** (asked by Rixilius)  
A: OpenAI with text-embedding-3-large model and 3072 dimensions, plus Google's Gemini model for contextual chunking. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Doesn't Shaw read the Discord chat? Why doesn't he communicate with us?** (asked by Skullcross)  
A: He definitely monitors but is pretty busy. If you had questions for him I bet he'd make the effort to answer them. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: So twitter accounts gone forever?** (asked by mat)  
A: We'll be back, Eliza's just spreading her wings. (answered by ben)
