## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I create an agent for my Discord channel?**  
A: Use Cursor AI to help with installation, fork the main repo, clone it locally, and add the ElizaOS doc repo in settings (answered by DorianD)

**Q: What's happening with the X/Twitter accounts?**  
A: The team has a resolution with X in sight and communications between teams have become quicker (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Which X accounts should I follow for ElizaOS updates?**  
A: Follow the team members listed, as they're holding off on starting new accounts while resolving the X situation (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?**  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)

**Q: Which embedding provider is best for plugin-knowledge?**  
A: OpenAI with text-embedding-3-large model and 3072 dimensions, plus contextual chunking with Google's Gemini model for decent results. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Doesn't Shaw read the Discord chat? Why doesn't he communicate with us?**  
A: He definitely monitors but is pretty busy. If you had questions for him I bet he'd make the effort to answer them. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: So twitter accounts gone forever?**
