## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I create an agent for my Discord channel?** (asked by 3on_)

**Q: What's happening with the X/Twitter accounts?** (asked by Gianni)  
A: The team has a resolution with X in sight and communications between teams have become quicker. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Which embedding provider is best for plugin-knowledge?** (asked by Rixilius)  
A: OpenAI with text-embedding-3-large model and 3072 dimensions, plus Google's gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview for contextual chunking. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?** (asked by Snapper)  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)
