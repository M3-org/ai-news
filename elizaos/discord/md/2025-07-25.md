## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I create my first agent for my Discord channel?** (asked by 3on_)  
**A:** Use Cursor AI, fork the main repo in GitHub, git clone it locally, and add the ElizaOS doc repo in settings to help the agent index files (answered by DorianD)

**Q: What's happening with the X/Twitter accounts for ElizaOS?** (asked by Gianni)  
**A:** They have a resolution with X in sight and communications between teams have become quicker; they're holding off starting new accounts (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Which X accounts should I follow for ElizaOS updates?** (asked by Hannes K.)  
**A:** Follow the team members behind the elizaOS framework (answered by Kenk with a list of team members)

**Q: Which embedding provider is best for plugin-knowledge?** (asked by Rixilius)  
**A:** 0xbbjoker recommends OpenAI with text-embedding-3-large model and 3072 dimensions, plus Google's Gemini model for contextual chunking.

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?** (asked by Snapper)  
**A:** No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaOS ecosystem?** (asked by CULTVESTING)  
**A:** The opportunity ranges across verticals from IP to Content Creators; seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Doesn't Shaw read the Discord chat? Why doesn't he communicate with us?** (asked by Skullcross)  
**A:** He definitely monitors but is pretty busy. If you had questions for him I bet he'd make the effort to answer them. (answered by Kenk)
