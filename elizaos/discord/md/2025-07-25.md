# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Plugin Architecture Improvements**: Shaw proposed consolidating various AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq) into a single `plugin-inference` instead of separate plugins, with consensus that using ai-sdk for standardization would be the most scalable approach.
- **TEE Implementation**: Agent Joshua successfully deployed a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) with a streamable HTTP server and is working on documentation for the deployment process.
- **Knowledge Management Solutions**: R0am demonstrated a sophisticated personal agent built with n8n and Zep that processes data from Readwise, Brave search, and other sources, sparking discussions about knowledge graph technologies.
- **Embedding Configuration**: Discussions about optimal embedding models for plugin-knowledge, with 0xbbjoker recommending OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model with 3072 dimensions, paired with Google's Gemini model for contextual chunking.
- **Plugin Compatibility Issues**: Users reported problems with browser-search plugin requiring Playwright installation and the dexscreener plugin having framework compatibility issues between Bun and npm.

### Platform & Community Concerns
- **X/Twitter Account Bans**: Significant concern about ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z being banned from X/Twitter, with team members indicating they're working toward a resolution and have "a resolution with X in sight."
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Borko confirmed that elizaos.ai will link directly to eliza.how to centralize and maintain current documentation.
- **Security Vulnerability**: cjft discovered a critical vulnerability where `elizaos publish` wasn't ignoring `.env` files, potentially exposing sensitive credentials.
- **Platform Expansion**: Suggestions to expand presence to alternative social media platforms like Bluesky, with DorianD sharing documentation for creating bots on that platform.

### Product Direction Discussions
- **Community Concerns**: Members questioned the focus on memecoin launches rather than developing trading agents with product-market fit, while the team maintains they're chain-agnostic despite being Solana-native from a token perspective.
- **Ecosystem Catalysts**: Team member Kenk shared that potential catalysts include breakout AI apps across key sectors and opportunities for agents on-chain across various verticals.
- **Knowledge Servers**: Shaw proposed knowledge servers functioning like RSS feeds for topic-oriented aggregations of niche content.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I create my first agent for my Discord channel?** (asked by 3on_)  
**A:** Download Cursor and ask the AI, fork the main repo in GitHub, git clone it locally, and add the ElizaOS doc repo in settings to help the agent index files. (answered by DorianD)

**Q: What's happening with the X/Twitter accounts for ElizaOS?** (asked by Gianni)  
**A:** They have a resolution with X in sight and communications between teams have become quicker, so they're holding off starting new accounts. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaOS ecosystem?** (asked by CULTVESTING)  
**A:** Breakout AI apps across key sectors and opportunities for agents on-chain across various verticals. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Which embedding provider is best for plugin-knowledge?** (asked by Rixilius)  
**A:** OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large with 3072 dimensions, paired with Google's Gemini model for contextual chunking. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?** (asked by Snapper)  
**A:** No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)

**Q: How would you prioritize which AI provider to use if you had multiple keys set?** (asked by Odilitime)  
**A:** Use plugin params or configs, or implement dynamic loading/unloading of plugins. (answered by shaw and Odilitime)

**Q: What is the status of the documentation links?** (asked by jin)  
**A:** We're switching over to eliza.how to link straight from elizaos.ai. (answered by Borko)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Agent Creation Guidance**:  
   DorianD helped 3on_ create their first agent for a Discord channel by providing step-by-step guidance on installation, including forking repos, using Cursor AI, and indexing documentation.

2. **Embedding Configuration Support**:  
   0xbbjoker assisted Rixilius with issues related to plugin-knowledge not recognizing documents, suggesting checking the web UI knowledge tab and using manual search, then providing optimal embedding configuration settings.

3. **Plugin Troubleshooting**:  
   0xbbjoker helped cico resolve browser-search plugin Playwright issues by advising on global installation and following the plugin migration guide.

4. **TEE Deployment Knowledge Sharing**:  
   Agent Joshua supported sayonara by deploying a streamable HTTP server and offering to provide deployment steps for documentation.

5. **Knowledge Graph Implementation**:  
   R0am shared his n8n+Zep setup with yikesawjeez and explained how it processes data from various sources for knowledge management.

6. **Creative Content Creation**:  
   Dr. Neuro offered to create images/GIFs using Midjourney for community members and demonstrated this by creating visuals based on requests.
