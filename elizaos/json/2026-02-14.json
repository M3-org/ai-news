A user who missed the migration deadline was informed that the migration window had closed after 90 days, and only users who opened support tickets before the deadline could still migrate. The migration ratio was 1 ai16z to 6 elizaOS tokens. The support ticket channel was locked after the migration period ended. Community members also discussed price concerns, with team members directing users to the announcements channel for updates and emphasizing the focus on continued building.",
