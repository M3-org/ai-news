          "text": "Community members discussed the Milaidy project and its connection to ElizaOS. Shaw announced the upcoming launch of the Milaidy app, clarifying that while he did not create the associated token, he accepted fees to pay developers building it and will never sell. The project demonstrates the versatility of ElizaOS framework. There was discussion about whether the base ElizaOS install should include system prompting that makes it aware of ElizaCloud capabilities and suggests them as solution sets, for both ElizaOS and the Milaidy fork. The Openclaw adapter was completed quickly, though there was discussion about how Openclaw gained attention a year after the original build.",

          "text": "Multiple users reported missing the ai16z to ElizaOS migration deadline, which closed on February 4th after a 90-day window. Long-term holders who had tokens in their wallets since before the November 11th snapshot expressed frustration at being locked out despite being able to prove on-chain holdings via Solscan. Users argued that the migration policy contradicts crypto values of decentralization and community building by punishing loyal holders who were simply holding rather than actively monitoring announcements. Community moderators confirmed that the migration period has ended and no further migrations can be processed. There were also reports of scammers creating fake support threads in the coders channel attempting to exploit users seeking migration help.",

          "text": "Discussion highlighted concerns about ElizaOS token utility and market performance. Users noted that the ElizaOS framework is not tied to the token at all, providing zero reason to buy the token, which was identified as the biggest hurdle for the project. The token has a market cap of only 12 million dollars, which users found surprisingly low compared to meme tokens with over 100 million market caps. One response mentioned that the team plans to use revenue generated by Eliza Cloud to buyback tokens. Community members noted that during the previous run-up, almost all of crypto Twitter was discussing the project. There was also nostalgic discussion about losing the memetic power of the original ai16z branding with its VC-themed AI agents Marc, Eliza, and Degen.",

There were questions about when staking would become available, with responses indicating it would launch after the JEJU platform goes live. Users celebrated a green day for the token price and expressed confidence that significant growth would be seen by the end of 2026.",
