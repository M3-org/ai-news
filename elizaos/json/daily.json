          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility. The team recommended users experiencing similar issues either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5.",

Odilitime welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/. The lead developer also mentioned upcoming open sessions and recommended connecting with the team. The contributor was directed to explore the Spartan project (https://github.com/elizaos/spartan), which focuses on DeFi utilities and quantitative trading features.",

The error indicated that columns would be dropped unless explicitly allowed. The solution provided was to either set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development or use the `elizaos dev` command for continuous monitoring during development. This is safe for local environments but requires careful review for production deployments.",

Users noted that the CA wasn't posted on official X accounts, making it hard for newcomers to verify legitimate tokens. Shaw acknowledged the feedback and committed to addressing this issue. There was discussion about whether to include CAs in Twitter bios or pinned tweets, with the team noting that most top projects don't follow this pattern but agreeing that the current flow doesn't work well. The team mentioned that the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for easier token information access.",

The document is available at https://hackmd.io/@0PzDTGXqRg6nOCDoEwaN-A/SyDNAAiVWe\n\n- **Messaging API Refactoring**: Stan submitted PRs for unified messaging API implementation in both Telegram and Discord plugins, moving from deprecated `sendMessage` to `handleMessage` for better consistency.\n\n- **Gateway Architecture**: Discussion around Discord bridge implementation, with Odilitime recommending review of the Jeju cloud branch (https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway) for Shaw's preferred implementation. The team discussed scaling considerations for event pumps, noting that voice connections will need higher priority/bandwidth than text.\n\n- **Documentation**: Jin shared the team's HackMD workspace at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book for collaborative documentation.",
