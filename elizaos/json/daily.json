          "text": "Development teams are actively working on Milaidy, the next-generation version of Eliza. Key technical issues being addressed include plugin loading failures related to MAX_EMBEDDING_TOKENS missing from AI provider plugins, and character customization challenges. The team is seeking testers who are comfortable setting up AI agents and can provide structured feedback on bugs. A character editor is being integrated, and developers are working on resolving wallet fixes and plugin integration issues. Performance optimization is a priority, with the logs table causing significant slowdowns in Postgres that affect Eliza response times.",

          "text": "Community sentiment has deteriorated significantly as the token price dropped to 0.0013, with holders expressing frustration over lack of communication and product delivery. Long-term holders who have waited over a year are questioning the team's responsibility and demanding clarity on token use cases and upcoming products. ElizaOS is scheduled to be delisted from three Korean exchanges, marking what community members describe as the end of the road in Korea. Critics point to key developers leaving the team, daily price declines, and absence of clear value propositions. Community members report being muted or banned for voicing dissatisfaction, raising concerns about how the team manages community feedback.",

The team is actively recruiting testers for the next-generation Eliza version through the coders channel, with meaningful contributions to be rewarded. There is currently no staking available for ELIZAOS tokens. Some community members remain optimistic, with reports that crypto influencer Crypto Gains is heavily invested and planning a bullish video on ELIZAOS.",
