          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap for version 1.7.0, though additional work was needed for full Discord plugin compatibility. The team recommended users either downgrade to core version 1.6.5 or wait for the updated release.",

Odilitime welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on existing plugins, pointing to github.com/elizaos-plugins/ as a resource. The lead developer of the Spartan project (https://github.com/elizaos/spartan) offered to connect and discuss DeFi utilities. K_carv recommended connecting with Odilitime and mentioned upcoming open sessions for collaboration.",
