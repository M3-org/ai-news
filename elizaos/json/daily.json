Users who missed the deadline can still hold or swap their ai16z tokens at their leisure, but the team will not migrate tokens purchased after the snapshot. The bridging to other chains is optional, and tokens can remain on Solana. Some users experienced confusion about the deadline due to notification overload.",

The team highlighted that ElizaOS has had cron jobs and autonomous capabilities for agents for a long time, with autonomous mode enabled via AgentRuntime configuration. However, there is a fundamental problem that developers are not utilizing these existing features. Shaw emphasized that ElizaOS has a better framework through extensive battle testing, but it has not been packaged or presented well.",

However, the consensus was that while OpenClaw has good UX and self-modifying loops, it cannot build serious projects like Spartan using just markdown files. The framework is seen as personal-focused while ElizaOS is business-focused. The team is learning from OpenClaw but maintains that ElizaOS has superior underlying technology.",
