          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap for version 1.7.0, though additional work was needed for full Discord 1.3.3 compatibility. The team recommended users either wait for the fix or downgrade to core version 1.6.5 as a temporary workaround.",

Odilitime recommended starting by reading the code and working on existing plugins, directing them to github.com/elizaos-plugins/ for available plugins. The lead developer also suggested connecting to discuss the Spartan project, which focuses on DeFi utilities. The community welcomed the new contributor and encouraged exploration of the open-source codebase.",

The error required either deleting the `.eliza` folder or setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true`. Community helper stackweaver explained this is a safety feature to prevent data loss and recommended using `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start` for local development. Omid Sa suggested using `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.",

Users noted it was too hard for most people to find the right CAs within 10 seconds. Shaw acknowledged the feedback and committed to posting the CA across official accounts. However, Kenk pushed back on the idea of pinning CAs in bios or tweets, noting that top crypto projects typically don't do this and instead link to websites where token info is one click away. The team confirmed they're refreshing their Linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier access to contract information.",
