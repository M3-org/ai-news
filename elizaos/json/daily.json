The main problem involved serverId vs messageServerId migration causing \"No server ID found\" errors. A fix was submitted via PR #6333, though it still requires testing with discord plugin version 1.3.3. Users experiencing issues were advised to either wait for the fix or try using core version 1.6.5 as a temporary workaround. The team acknowledged the need to rush out a release with this critical fix.",

The team acknowledged this issue and committed to addressing it. Shaw confirmed they will post the CA across official accounts. Discussion ensued about best practices, with some noting that top projects don't typically put CAs in bios as it can appear scam-like. The consensus was that a pinned tweet on the Eliza account or better website integration would be more appropriate. The linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information.",
