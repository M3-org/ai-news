Odilitime created a branch (odi-17) with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers and submitted PR #6333 to address user-reported issues with version 1.7.0. The team discussed the need to rush out a release with these fixes. However, compatibility issues remained with discord plugin version 1.3.3, requiring additional testing with various discord branches and a new discord release.",

Odilitime recommended either using an older core version like 1.6.5 or waiting for the fixes in the odi-17 branch.
