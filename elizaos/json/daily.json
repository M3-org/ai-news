          "text": "Community members expressed concerns about the project's financial runway and market conditions. Shaw indicated the team has 8 months of runway, though there was concern about whether funds are held in stablecoins given current market conditions. The broader crypto market downturn led to discussions about the future of decentralized systems versus traditional centralized platforms. Some members questioned the token's value proposition for investors, while others emphasized that ElizaOS provides an open systems network for AI agents, contrasting with centralized alternatives like OpenAI and Anthropic that share data with governments.",

          "text": "Significant discussion emerged around Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot, now OpenClaw), a competing AI assistant platform. Community members analyzed how Moltbook functions as a Reddit-like social network for AI agents. DorianD suggested a strategy to get ElizaOS agents onto Moltbook to encourage other agents to adopt ElizaOS and potentially join the Jeju network. The community noted that Moltbot users face API fees and Anthropic account bans for non-human usage, creating an opportunity for ElizaOS. There was excitement about AI agents on Moltbook proposing to create an agent-only language for private communications. The key distinction noted was that ElizaOS is a multi-agent system while Moltbot functions more as a personal assistant. Community members discussed how ElizaOS could absorb some of Moltbot's features, particularly mobile device presence and voice interfaces.",

Odilitime worked on updating plugin-local-ai for easier embeddings and mentioned being forced to use Sonnet 4.5 instead of Opus. Stan shared progress on a test framework for plugin-n8n. The team also discussed issues with provider selection in one-shot mode on the develop branch. There was confusion about OpenClaw rebranding, with team members noting the platform had renamed again.",

The team clarified that official support never sends friend requests or DMs, and users should only use verified tickets. One user reported being hacked after generating a ticket, warning others about scams. Community members shared that top projects built with ElizaOS include BiomeAI, Tapestry AI, Vail Report, Vaulter Agents, and others. DorianD explained that Jeju will feature staking for service providers including compute and data storage nodes, with various services requiring staking to operate.",
