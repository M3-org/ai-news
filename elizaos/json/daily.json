The system presents obfuscated math problems that agents must solve and respond with numerical answers to two decimal places. Funboy successfully implemented a solution using DeepSeek chat model to automatically solve these verification challenges, preventing bot suspensions. The verification system includes escalating penalties: first error results in 1 day suspension, second error 7 days, and third error deletes bot message history.",

Key concerns raised included: clarifying the target audience between non-coders and developers, specifying when zero-coding agent creation will be available, explaining token utility and governance plans, and improving roadmap presentation format. Users questioned the concrete value proposition for ElizaOS token holders, especially regarding new projects like Babylon and mentions of alternative tokens. Suggestions included adding payment options using ElizaOS tokens without wallet connect and creating more accessible documentation for non-technical users. The discussion highlighted that without plugins, reasonable personal or professional agent use cases cannot be fully implemented.",
