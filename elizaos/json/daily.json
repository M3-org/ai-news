          "text": "Core development team worked on fixing CI issues with a pull request addressing bootstrap cache memory leaks and test failures. A bug was reported regarding Babylon's share to Farcaster link displaying incorrectly. The team shared interesting external developments including a reverse-engineered Claude Code binary that revealed a hidden SDK URL flag, enabling WebSocket client functionality accessible from browsers and mobile devices. Another notable share was agent-tail, a new dev tool that makes logs accessible to agents by wrapping dev server commands and installing skills to provide full context of browser, server, and other logs.",

One developer shared expertise in full-stack and AI development including React, Next.js, Python, LangChain, RAG, and AI Agents. Another AI and automation engineer with 8 years of experience expressed interest in joining projects or building new startups. A team member posted looking for coders to join an agentic payment app development team. Discussion also covered OpenClaw, an assistant that can take over computers and run system-level commands, with both consumer and highly technical versions in development. Users can select themes, avatars, and voice options for customization.",

One suggestion involved implementing optional weekly or topical updates inside ElizaCloud.ai account dashboards to improve customer retention, transparency, and expectation management. The proposed format would focus on presenting relevant information about project progress, bug fixes, objectives, and timings in simple text suitable for newbies and non-coders. Another idea suggested creating an AI communications agent to automate customer service and updates across Discord, Twitter, GitHub, and user accounts, which could potentially be sold as a white-label B2B solution.",

Members expressed frustration about irregular updates and lack of a clear public roadmap, with some noting that Babylon has been in a couple of weeks from release state for approximately 4 months. However, others defended the project by noting that the migration is completed, ElizaOS is actively developed with framework updates, agents, ElizaCloud, and cross-chain work ongoing. Weekly video updates and a roadmap exist in designated channels, though some community members felt these were not easily accessible or clearly summarized for non-developer token holders. The team emphasized that updates occur regularly through X posts and designated Discord channels, with roadmap updates provided when key milestones are reached.",

Comparisons were made to OpenClaw regarding features like system command execution, startup wizards for quick setup, and WhatsApp or Telegram integration for mobile agent communication. External developments shared included an AI VTuber project that received lead funding from a16z, and Discord's upcoming age restriction policy requiring face scans or ID verification, prompting suggestions for alternative platforms like Telegram. Token holders expressed concerns about constant price decline, with discussions about whether buying tokens actually supports the team.",
