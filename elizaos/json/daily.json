          "text": "Community members expressed significant concerns about the lack of clear tokenomics and utility for the elizaOS token. Multiple users questioned what actual use cases exist for the token beyond paying gas fees in the planned Jeju network. The sentiment was that the token has become essentially a memecoin with no clear mechanism for price appreciation. Users noted that even after reviewing the team's roadmap, they cannot see how the token connects to the project's vision. The migration from ai16z to elizaOS did not appear to change anything fundamental about the token's utility.",

Community members expressed frustration that there is no cohesive strategy connecting the token to the project's development. The Jeju network documentation shows 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, but the timeline for implementation remains unclear. Users noted that without clear tokenomics, investors are essentially investing with their eyes closed.",

The token has dropped 70% twice in recent weeks with zero demand. Users emphasized that the number one priority should be establishing a clear reason to buy or hold elizaOS tokens. The complaint was that the team operates in a black box without providing consistent roadmap communication regarding token direction. Multiple members noted that everyday people ask about token utility and roadmap, indicating a fundamental messaging problem.",

This would position core developers as thought leaders in the space beyond just coding. The team also discussed creating better visual explanations of the project roadmap showing the progression from framework to ElizaCloud to Jeju network.",

Users noted that Bitcoin and Ethereum succeeded because they created public utility networks that transcend corporations and governments. The elizaOS project needs to articulate a similar vision for decentralized AI agent infrastructure. The suggestion was made that buybacks from ElizaCloud could be a turning point, but currently the token is just another memecoin. Team members acknowledged they are working on token economy details but are constrained by what they can announce publicly.",

A critical SQL error was successfully resolved where the database adapter was hardcoded to use a dim_1536 column, which caused errors when creating entities and failed to respect the USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING configuration. This embedding dimension issue has been fixed and closed. Additionally, a new pull request was opened to introduce a dynamic execution engine for version 2.0.0, with a focus on testing context handling. This feature is currently in progress as part of the ongoing development work.",
