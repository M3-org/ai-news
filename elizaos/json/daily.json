Multiple users asked if they are the same token, with conflicting responses. While some community members initially said yes, Odilitime clarified they are different contracts and that ai16z is worth way less. Users expressed concern about missing the migration deadline and the ongoing price decline of over 70 percent. DorianD explained the token has no use case and attributed the decline to crypto winter and the loss of memetic appeal from the ai16z rebrand to the less memorable elizaos ticker.",

Odilitime stated that ElizaOS performs better on benchmarks, has more connectors, and is more reliable than alternatives since it is not self-configuring. The project received a golden checkmark verification, which was celebrated by community members. Shaw shared a thread clarifying his current role as CTO at Eliza Labs. The best demo was noted to be running on the Babylon discord in 'the hanging plaza' with multiple agents deployed. ElizaOS was also submitted to participate in the BNB Chain hackathon 'Good Vibes Only: OpenClaw Edition' with community members encouraged to vote.",

One user complained that previous supporters are no longer focusing on ElizaOS or have removed it from their bios, questioning what happened to promised promotion and marketing after autofun flopped and asking about the status of Elizacloud. However, other community members remained supportive, with one posting that ElizaOS will win because of Shaw's vision and understanding of the technology, emphasizing the importance of understanding a leader's perspective to know where the company is heading.",
