          "text": "Token Price Manipulation and Investment Concerns: Community members discussed significant price manipulation of the ElizaOS token by whales controlling large portions of the supply. Users noted continuous downward pressure resembling team selling to cover expenses, with the token dropping back under 3 cents despite brief recovery attempts. Multiple users emphasized that investors should have sold during pumps, as the price action is unnatural and the token carries high risk. Some members reported being down 60 percent after entering post-pump. The consensus was that while the project itself is interesting, the token performance has been poor, with advice to only invest what one can afford to lose.",

Core developers clarified that any commits can be faked in Git by using anyone's email addresses, and that these were commits moved from other projects. The team confirmed that if something is not in official announcements, it is not legitimate. Users were reminded to verify authenticity through official channels only.",

The system handles approximately 600 transactions per second with transfers averaging under 150 milliseconds using stacked nodes. The infrastructure includes real-time feeds from 5,000 Twitter accounts, token tracking, PNL and FDV monitoring directly from program IDs, and detection of bundles, KOL activity, developer sells, rugs, and holder transactions. The developer uses Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth GRPC streaming and Jito's ShredStream for ultra-fast data transmission, providing approximately 32 milliseconds improvement over standard methods. The system is built primarily in Rust and automatically creates trackers for tokens with smart exits at different levels including trailing stops and volume-based exits. The developer is exploring integrating ElizaOS to automate an autonomous launcher agent based on hot trends, narratives, and breaking news from Twitter feeds.",
