Users shared information about Behavidence, an AI algorithm called Dopa One that can monitor and detect fluctuations in brain dopamine levels through mobile phones and wearable devices. The technology provides daily feedback on mental well-being based on digital behavior patterns, giving similarity scores for ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. There was interest in potentially integrating this technology into future ElizaOS Phone applications to help agents monitor user mental health while ensuring engagement.",
