A LinkedIn post highlighted security setup guides for Openclaw/Moltbot/Clawdbot aimed at non-technical users, demonstrating community efforts to make the technology more accessible.",

Multiple users expressed concerns about continuous price drops, with the token down significantly from highs. Confusion emerged around Korean exchange listings, with claims of delisting from Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit, though some community members disputed these claims. Users debated whether the old AI16Z token or new ElizaOS token was affected. Token holders called for more transparency and concrete plans from the team regarding token utility and use cases.",
