          "text": "Community members engaged in extensive discussions about the ElizaOS token and project direction. Key concerns raised included the token's poor performance following the migration from ai16z to elizaOS, with users noting the loss of the original memetic branding around a VC fund led by KOL clones. The tribute model where new agents gave 5-10% to the DAO was discontinued after receiving tokens that couldn't be effectively traded or utilized. DorianD identified three major weaknesses: lack of live agents on social media enabling meaningful stack interaction, communication failures resulting in negative sentiment from influential groups, and insufficient investor excitement due to unclear token utility. The team acknowledged these challenges, with Odilitime stating that if you're here, it's for the long term because recovery will take time. There was consensus that 2026 is a building year with no expectation of major gains. Users suggested that recovery depends on ElizaCloud gaining users and the Jeju network becoming operational, though current agent numbers are insufficient for profitability. The importance of maintaining best-in-class services with well-documented APIs was emphasized, similar to how Clanker and Bankr agents have succeeded.",

          "text": "Users reported multiple technical issues with ElizaCloud platform. DorianD identified scrolling problems on the API explorer page where mousepad scrolling was broken and users had to manually drag the barely visible scrollbar. The API testing functionality showed errors stating api key is required for this endpoint when attempting to send test requests, despite an API key appearing to be present in the interface. Users requested clearer pricing breakdowns per model and clarification on whether the use a different key option allows bringing your own keys from providers like OpenAI similar to OpenRouter. Odilitime confirmed receiving the bug reports and forwarded them to the development team. A user also inquired about whether there was still a live Eliza agent available to answer questions about the most recent ElizaOS codebase.",

          "text": "General community discussions included criticism of Shaw's communication approach, with one user expressing frustration about the lack of updates following the Elon Musk Twitter ban incident and questioning what happened with the promised lawsuit and marketing push after Autofun went down. The user argued Shaw is too influential to act naive and his actions have consequences for token holders. Odilitime responded that the team is still pushing out promised products, with Babylon now open to the top 5000 on the waitlist, and noted Shaw has given updates on Twitter. He clarified that Shaw posts AI and dev content on Twitter while crypto content goes on Farcaster as he tries to drive more people to that platform. A developer offered services for anyone with project ideas or active projects in progress. Odilitime also asked how many community members still needed to complete their migration.",

        "text": "On February 20, 2026, ElizaOS made significant progress across multiple areas. The platform completed core enhancements including adding Discord as a fourth messaging option on the main landing site and establishing baseline product metrics for beta launch tracking. Active development work includes a new chatbot widget called 'Vera - Virtually Ever After' in the vea-chatbot module, strict typing refactoring for the logger runtime, and dependency updates across four packages in three directories. A critical fix addresses AI node multi-step confabulation issues in the n8n workflow plugin. The community has initiated discussions on inter-agent coordination and cross-instance communication patterns for multi-agent scenarios, along with proposed enhancements for both Twitter and Google MCPs that reference related pull requests in eliza-cloud-v2.",
