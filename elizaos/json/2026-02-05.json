          "text": "ElizaCloud platform experienced critical bugs affecting user onboarding and retention. Users reported that promised 5 USD credits were not being added to new accounts, and clicking the 'get started' button in welcome emails was overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only 1 USD balance instead. Additional issues included blocked payment pages when using VPNs and inability to transfer tokens between accounts. The team acknowledged these as serious problems affecting customer retention. A solution was proposed to give each account a wallet address for direct token deposits to enable easier recharging without wallet connections.",

Developers reported API endpoint failures and users getting stuck on certain pages. Username creation was malfunctioning, with users receiving '@userid:priv' as their username. Discord OAuth integration and Twitter follow rewards were broken. The development team pushed fixes for these issues, with tcm390 merging solutions to production. The platform allows users with ElizaLabs.ai emails to receive admin/mod privileges automatically. Testing was ongoing with the development team working to resolve issues before wider release.",

Users who missed the 90-day migration window expressed frustration that the migration website was deactivated and they could no longer convert their tokens. Critics argued that three months was insufficient time for holders who may be traveling or away from their wallets, calling the deadline deliberately calculated to penalize absent investors. Team members clarified that it was a migration, not an airdrop, and that the deadline had been open since November. Non-migrated ELIZA tokens in the migrator are reportedly locked for one year. The situation highlighted tensions between the team's technical requirements and community accessibility concerns.",
