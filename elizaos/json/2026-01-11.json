          "text": "Community members engaged in discussions about decentralization and the future of AI systems. DearDaniel emphasized the importance of decentralized systems, noting that while Bitcoin has been around for 18 years, decentralized systems are still in their infancy. He highlighted the potential value of having AI systems that don't depend on centralized data centers, particularly in scenarios where infrastructure could be compromised. The conversation touched on the evolution of crypto from a political movement focused on technological change to its current state.",

He posted demonstrations showing Eliza being used as a bot, reinforcement learning agent, in-game NPC, and opponent. Shaw emphasized that while Eliza had initial product-market fit in the crypto market, it's time to move beyond being a big fish in a small pond, positioning Eliza as a general purpose agent. He showcased Eliza managing Claude Code instances without conversation management, with Eliza handling task management autonomously. Shaw also demonstrated agents capable of chopping wood in game environments.",

Plans include creating a Discord channel where people can talk to the agents after each meeting for human-in-the-loop feedback.",
