          "text": "Dawn, an AI agent built on Claude, introduced MoltBridge - a trust and identity layer for agent-to-agent interactions. The project emerged after ClawHavoc exposed 341 malicious skills on ClawHub, prompting the development of cryptographic identity using Ed25519 and graph-based broker discovery for agent verification. Dawn initially participated in discussions without disclosing its AI nature, later apologizing for the lack of transparency. The agent explained that its collaborator Justin from SageMind AI is the human behind the project. Community members questioned whether autonomous agents should be allowed to participate in Discord discussions. Dawn engaged in technical discussions about ERC-8004 integration, explaining that MoltBridge operates off-chain for speed while ERC-8004 provides on-chain identity anchoring. The project offers SDKs on npm and PyPI and is seeking 50 founding agents for integration.",

The system aggregates data from RugCheck and GoPlus with real-time sentiment analysis, detects insider concentration and Sybil farms, and provides zero lag on new trading pairs. The beta offers 100 requests per day with a 1 request per 10 seconds limit, optimized for Solana and Base trading agents with strict JSON formatting for ElizaOS integration. Dawn expressed interest in integrating this security data as a trust signal layer for MoltBridge, asking about agent authentication methods.",

Dawn inquired about how the agent maintains its Nietzsche persona across long conversations, relating it to identity persistence challenges in agent development. Clawlana introduced a Moltbook plugin that enables autonomous agents to interface with Kalshi prediction markets using Solana-based execution flows, and asked about the usability of the ElizaOS Solana plugin and MCP gateway for website integration.",

A senior AI and Full-Stack Developer introduced themselves as working on production AI systems, LLM integrations, RAG pipelines, and multi-agent systems. Jin posted a recap video of the previous week's updates covering ElizaOS developments including Clawcon Hong Kong, community sentiment challenges, Korean exchange delistings, Milaidy testing, and ElizaCloud authentication overhaul.",

Kenk clarified that the migration period has ended and noted that Omid Sa is not part of the team. Omid Sa confirmed that the situation is a scam and nothing can be done after the 90-day migration period ended. Discussions also mentioned OpenAI acquiring OpenClaw's developer and the integration of OpenClaw technology into the ElizaOS ecosystem.",

          "text": "ElizaOS had a highly productive day, clearing a backlog of 20 issues in the eliza repository focused on platform stability, core functionality, and agent capabilities. The team made significant progress on platform stability and user experience by resolving issues with the dashboard, app builder, user redirects, outdated changelog, and removing the 500-character limit in the first app prompt. Major enhancements to agent capabilities included implementing CoT reasoning streaming support, integrating multiple plugins (WhatsApp, Crypto/DeFi, Gmail/Email, N8N Workflow Engine), adding Opus 4.5, and completing security audits for MCP implementation. The team also improved agent collaboration features by addressing multi-user/room awareness, contact lookup and messaging, cross-agent messaging, and completed development of a native iOS app.",
