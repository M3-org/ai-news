        "text": "Community members discussed the Babylon project timeline and token launch. When asked about the Babylon airdrop, Odilitime clarified that there is no token yet and the ICO is at least a couple months away. Only the non-chain Babylon launch is currently happening. Some community members expressed concern about the disconnect between Babylon and the ElizaOS token value, noting that Babylon's launch may not directly benefit ElizaOS token holders.",

        "text": "Core developers worked on consolidating n8n workflow plugins. Shaw requested that Stan consolidate the plugin-n8n-workflow with the existing plugin-n8n repository. Stan explained that his plugin is more comprehensive, featuring resilient workflow generation with auto-correction, OAuth handling, preview drafting, and minimal errors. The plugin has two modes: manual and integrated database for credential storage. Odilitime encountered build errors with missing JSON files, which Stan explained need to be generated by running the crawl script as documented in the README. The team also discussed creating a tool to push updates from version 1.x to 2.x branches to encourage adoption of the newer version.",

        "text": "Developers discussed wallet management approaches for AI agents. The conversation covered using Privy for agent authentication, where agents would receive app ID and secret ID to generate wallets. One approach suggested using HD wallets for branching control. Odilitime expressed concern that the OAuth approach feels heavy and relies too much on HTTP, preferring simpler wallet solutions. A developer also worked on the LunchTable TCG project and sought collaboration help, offering to split creator rewards. Multiple developers posted availability for collaboration opportunities.",

        "text": "Community members expressed concerns about ElizaOS token price performance. Users noted that other AI tokens are reaching all-time highs while ElizaOS remains down despite bright project prospects. One holder asked how to stop the bleeding, noting this is a critical crossroads for the project. A community member suggested the path forward involves transitioning from niche vision to real world ecosystem growth measured in active accounts, revenues, and subscriptions, plus product improvements and top user experience, with focus on initiatives that drive real ElizaOS token value. Another member noted that while Babylon is an addicting game with great catalysts upcoming, they believe Eliza will shine again soon.",
