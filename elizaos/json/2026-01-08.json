          "text": "Korean Exchange Delisting Controversy: Multiple Korean exchanges including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support for AI16Z and ElizaOS. The delisting was attributed to concerns about transparency and proper disclosure of material changes during the rebranding process. Korean community members explained that due to regulatory sensitivity in Korea and the migration controversies, there is virtually no chance of ElizaOS being listed on Korean exchanges in the near future. Some users disputed whether this was confirmed or just FUD, but Korean exchange notices were shared confirming the decision. The trading service termination is scheduled for February 12, 2026, with deposit and withdrawal services ending March 12, 2026.",

Users questioned why the token is not being used for payments or gas fees, and expressed confusion about the purpose of increasing supply without clear utility integration. One user specifically asked when ElizaOS would implement token-based features as previously mentioned. Migration issues continued with users reporting problems migrating AI16Z tokens from liquidity pools, with some receiving max amount reached errors. Users were directed to migration support channels for assistance.",

Proposals included creating an Eliza Phone App that would allow users to share their data in exchange for reputation points and rewards. Specific use cases mentioned included motion capture suits for activities like fishing, haircutting, and even battlefield scenarios, where people could earn royalties from inference when androids use those trained models. The concept extended to partnerships with companies like McDonalds to integrate Inertial Motion Capture Suits into uniforms, allowing employees to capture data while working. Discussion emphasized that grayscale video might be sufficient for movement analysis rather than full color.",

A new plugin, @kamiyo/eliza, was added to the registry, demonstrating continued growth in available integrations. The SQL plugin received important updates including Neon serverless support and improved Row-Level Security (RLS), enhancing both security and scalability of database interactions. However, several issues were identified that require attention, including inconsistent box sizes in the UI, intermittent web search functionality problems, and needed improvements to the agent builder interface such as capitalizing default agent names on mobile and updating copy text for both the agent edit and agent builder interfaces.",
