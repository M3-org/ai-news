          "text": "Community members engaged in extensive discussion about cryptocurrency investment philosophy and market sentiment. Users debated the difference between investing and gambling in crypto, with some arguing that holding positions longer than a year constitutes investing while shorter timeframes are gambling. The conversation touched on emotional responses to price drops, with experienced members emphasizing the importance of thick skin and diversification. Discussion included the upcoming Quantitative Easing cycle that started in December after years of contraction, which is expected to provide tailwinds for crypto markets in the coming months. The Russell index hitting all-time highs was cited as a positive indicator for what may come to crypto microcaps.",

The moderation bot uses educational timeouts starting at 60 seconds for first offenses, doubling with each subsequent violation rather than permanent bans.",
