          "text": "Community members expressed support for the development team amid token performance concerns. A supporter emphasized that the investment was always a bet on Shaw and the team's ability to deliver, highlighting their position as leading AI agent developers. They noted multiple products in development including Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC desk, and Eliza Anime, with the strategy being to reward long-term holders through airdrops when one of these products goes viral. The message encouraged critics to sell if they don't believe in the vision and let developers continue building.",

The issue was identified as contextual embeddings being enabled. A core developer provided a minimal configuration solution using OpenRouter and recommended using basic text embedding models. The team also shared cost data showing a 3.1MB PDF book with 517 chunks as a reference point for expected embedding costs.",

          "text": "Core developers pivoted strategy toward building Eliza as a comprehensive AI assistant application, inspired by Clawdbot's success. Shaw identified this as a golden opportunity, noting that Clawdbot was created by ai16z and Molt is not currently trending. The team decided to focus on n8n workflow integration as the primary approach, with Shaw publishing Eliza 2.0.0 to npm under the next tag. The vision is to create an AI workflow builder that allows users to connect services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear through natural language commands with conditional logic. The team set up n8n cloud accounts and began integrating n8n-intelligence and n8n-workflow-builder open source projects. Developers emphasized that 95 percent of users want AI workflow building rather than auto-coding, with the goal of creating powerful abstractions that make integration easier.",

Questions were raised about whether trading on Solana DEXs would count for airdrops, but no official announcement has been made yet. Community members also discussed the need to restore ElizaOS memetic value and emphasized its nature as a community project.",
