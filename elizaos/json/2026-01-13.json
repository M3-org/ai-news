A Twitter Spaces event titled 'WTF is 8004?' was hosted, with participants experiencing technical difficulties including audio dropouts and connection issues. Users noted that Twitter Spaces has been buggy, particularly on desktop, with mobile iOS working more reliably. The ELIZAOSNY Twitter account shared content criticizing Solana's finance 2.0 messaging and promoting memecoin culture. There was discussion about ElizaBAO, a community member's project that is a Polymarket affiliate. ElizaBAO shared proof of real user registrations and deposits through their affiliate link. Community members also discussed partnership opportunities and developer availability.",

A significant discussion centered on DeepMind's Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a new AI architecture that doesn't require RAG and has perfect memory of everything it has read. The system can process prompts up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows. A developer shared instructions for uploading knowledge to the monorepo using the plugin-knowledge system, including creating a docs directory and configuring the character file. Another developer mentioned modifying plugin-bootstrap to search global facts without roomId and adding a post route for creating new memories. ElizaBAO announced a second top-up on elizaoscloud. Multiple developers posted looking for work opportunities.",
