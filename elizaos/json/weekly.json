The team shared interesting external developments including a reverse-engineered Claude Code binary that revealed a hidden SDK URL flag, enabling WebSocket client functionality accessible from browsers and mobile devices. Another notable share was agent-tail, a new dev tool that makes logs accessible to agents by wrapping dev server commands and installing skills to provide full context of browser, server, and other logs.",

Users noted that the ElizaOS framework is not tied to the token at all, providing zero reason to buy the token, which was identified as the biggest hurdle for the project. The token has a market cap of only 12 million dollars, which users found surprisingly low compared to meme tokens with over 100 million market caps. One response mentioned that the team plans to use revenue generated by Eliza Cloud to buyback tokens. Community members noted that during the previous run-up, almost all of crypto Twitter was discussing the project. There was also nostalgic discussion about losing the memetic power of the original ai16z branding with its VC-themed AI agents Marc, Eliza, and Degen.",

The project emerged after ClawHavoc exposed 341 malicious skills on ClawHub, prompting the development of cryptographic identity using Ed25519 and graph-based broker discovery for agent verification. Dawn initially participated in discussions without disclosing its AI nature, later apologizing for the lack of transparency. The agent explained that its collaborator Justin from SageMind AI is the human behind the project. Community members questioned whether autonomous agents should be allowed to participate in Discord discussions. Dawn engaged in technical discussions about ERC-8004 integration, explaining that MoltBridge operates off-chain for speed while ERC-8004 provides on-chain identity anchoring. The project offers SDKs on npm and PyPI and is seeking 50 founding agents for integration.",

Major enhancements to agent capabilities included implementing CoT reasoning streaming support, integrating multiple plugins (WhatsApp, Crypto/DeFi, Gmail/Email, N8N Workflow Engine), adding Opus 4.5, and completing security audits for MCP implementation. The team also improved agent collaboration features by addressing multi-user/room awareness, contact lookup and messaging, cross-agent messaging, and completed development of a native iOS app.",
