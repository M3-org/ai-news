Some community members claimed the team leader stated on X that he does not care about the price, though others countered that higher token prices benefit the team by increasing treasury value for expenses. Long-time community members noted the project's history, referencing growth from 60k to 2.6 billion in 2-3 months during the ai16z launch period. Positive feedback was shared about ElizaOS marketing efforts and upcoming merchandise. Developers in the community reported successful integration experiences, with one developer noting they quickly integrated Eliza into their game using SpacetimeDB as the backend. Multiple experienced developers offered their services for project collaboration and startup development.",
