          "text": "The ElizaOS team announced the launch of Milaidy, a personal AI assistant that runs on user devices. The project is described as an Eliza version of OpenClaw, featuring easy Mac app deployment, agent skills functionality, and all OpenClaw connectors as Eliza plugins with minimal bloat. The team is actively seeking help with bug fixes and development to get the project to production. Multiple community members responded to a call for testers, with experienced developers offering their skills in bug hunting, agent development, and software engineering. One developer submitted three pull requests and is awaiting confirmation on the contribution process. There was internal discussion about branding, with concerns that using the Milaidy name instead of Eliza branding could result in missed network effects, though the decision was made to cross-promote both projects.",

When asked about the Babylon airdrop, Odilitime clarified that there is no token yet and the ICO is at least a couple months away. Only the non-chain Babylon launch is currently happening. Some community members expressed concern about the disconnect between Babylon and the ElizaOS token value, noting that Babylon's launch may not directly benefit ElizaOS token holders.",

Stan explained that his plugin is more comprehensive, featuring resilient workflow generation with auto-correction, OAuth handling, preview drafting, and minimal errors. The plugin has two modes: manual and integrated database for credential storage. Odilitime encountered build errors with missing JSON files, which Stan explained need to be generated by running the crawl script as documented in the README. The team also discussed creating a tool to push updates from version 1.x to 2.x branches to encourage adoption of the newer version.",

A developer also worked on the LunchTable TCG project and sought collaboration help, offering to split creator rewards. Multiple developers posted availability for collaboration opportunities.",

Users noted that other AI tokens are reaching all-time highs while ElizaOS remains down despite bright project prospects. One holder asked how to stop the bleeding, noting this is a critical crossroads for the project. A community member suggested the path forward involves transitioning from niche vision to real world ecosystem growth measured in active accounts, revenues, and subscriptions, plus product improvements and top user experience, with focus on initiatives that drive real ElizaOS token value. Another member noted that while Babylon is an addicting game with great catalysts upcoming, they believe Eliza will shine again soon.",

The system presents obfuscated math problems that agents must solve and respond with numerical answers to two decimal places. Funboy successfully implemented a solution using DeepSeek chat model to automatically solve these verification challenges, preventing bot suspensions. The verification system includes escalating penalties: first error results in 1 day suspension, second error 7 days, and third error deletes bot message history.",

Key concerns raised included: clarifying the target audience between non-coders and developers, specifying when zero-coding agent creation will be available, explaining token utility and governance plans, and improving roadmap presentation format. Users questioned the concrete value proposition for ElizaOS token holders, especially regarding new projects like Babylon and mentions of alternative tokens. Suggestions included adding payment options using ElizaOS tokens without wallet connect and creating more accessible documentation for non-technical users. The discussion highlighted that without plugins, reasonable personal or professional agent use cases cannot be fully implemented.",
