          "text": "Core development discussions focused on several technical initiatives. The team explored PageIndex, a new open-source library that uses document trees instead of embeddings for RAG systems, achieving 98.7% accuracy on FinanceBench. There was debate about whether this approach works better than agentic search, with some noting that Cursor already uses agentic search. The team discussed integrating PageIndex via MCP and building encyclopedia-like tree structures. Docker compose workflows were being developed for GPU training and deployment. ElizaOS has had task scheduling capabilities since version 1.x, addressing concerns about agents needing manual prompting for recurring tasks.",

          "text": "Technical implementation challenges were discussed in the coders channel. Users reported issues with ElizaCloud API key creation requiring payment methods even with free credits. There were suggestions that agents should be able to top up credit accounts directly with x402 payments rather than using credit cards. The team discussed using Kimi 2.5 API via OpenRouter as a cost-effective alternative to Opus 4.5. Proposals included having an L2 network where nodes can donate compute to Eliza for resource-intensive tasks. Integration ideas between OpenClaw and ElizaCloud were explored, with considerations for future Jeju developments.",

Members emphasized that the team is building continuously despite price declines, with Shaw becoming more efficient at coding. There was acknowledgment of a marketing challenge - the market does not fully understand what is being built. Community members expressed confidence that once the building value transfers to the token ecosystem, there should be a sharp rise in price and attention. Comparisons were made to Apple's turnaround, with members focusing on long-term positioning rather than current price action. The team has 6-8 months of runway from SAFT funding, though this is dynamic based on revenue and costs.",

Users were directed to support channels for migration issues, particularly those showing zero balances. No specific airdrop details have been announced yet, with community members advised to stay tuned for official announcements. There was discussion about a Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders to be announced after migration ends, with users able to sign up for Babylon and earn points through tasks. Staking details were not yet available.",

Members debated whether users will trust traditional corporations like Google with their data versus setting up private agents with open source tools. There was acknowledgment that corporate AI systems face challenges from terms of service, profit pressures, and enshittification, while open source alternatives will catch up. The challenge remains convincing mainstream users to adopt decentralized solutions. Discussion of Freysa and FAI team raising funds via Echo with discounted tokens, though Echo itself was noted as not having enough investors currently.",

The team emphasized that ElizaOS enables building AI agents quickly - indie developers can fork ElizaOS, add a plugin, and deploy in a weekend, contrasting with traditional approaches of raising large funding and hiring many engineers.",
