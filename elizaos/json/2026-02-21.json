          "text": "Community members discussed the current state of crypto markets, with DorianD comparing the mid-2020s period to the 2014-2016 crypto downturn and the 2001-2003 tech period. In the coders channel, KingRon celebrated building their first agent, calling the project legitimate. There was discussion about deploying dApps to Solana seeker and opportunities in censorship-resistant gaming. Community members noted the channel seemed quieter than usual, with some wondering if there was a separate dev discord.",

          "text": "Odilitime, the head of engineering, provided extensive clarification about the ElizaOS ecosystem. He explained that ai16z has been migrated to elizaOS and is now a dead coin. The migration involved a 1:6 ratio with 1:4 used for funding and liquidity split across multiple chains instead of solely Solana. He clarified that ElizaOS is an agent framework that makes foundational models do more than they can on their own, similar to how OpenClaw operates. Odilitime revealed he invested approximately 10k in ElizaOS, 20k in DegenAI, and 8k in Cult token for the anime project. He emphasized betting on his team at DegenAI where he was hired, never selling those bags while having sold and rebought ElizaOS bags.",

          "text": "Technical discussions included guidance on using the v2.0.0 branch as the recommended version despite less documentation. Odilitime explained that plugin-sql supports both pglite and neon cloud databases, using environment variables for postgres credentials to decide which to use. A developer reported their openclaw agent started writing in Korean unexpectedly. New community members asked about investment rationale, with Odilitime explaining the project focuses on supporting open source builders to give everyday people the same capabilities as big companies, noting their code powers many agents especially in crypto with secure battle-tested open source code.",

          "text": "Odilitime detailed Spartan as an agentic wallet with trading capabilities, where DegenAI holders have access to the open source trader. He described it as a combination of trading bot potluck with LLM intelligence, allowing developers to review research and add their own contributions. He is now the lead developer on the project. The team is working on DeFi stacks after proving the framework's social capabilities. Odilitime expressed mixed feelings about Labs leadership, sometimes questioning their direction while other times feeling blessed by the team.",

      "content": {
        "text": "On February 21, 2026, the ElizaOS project experienced significant activity in expanding its plugin ecosystem. Two new plugin proposals were submitted: the @elizaos/plugin-xproof plugin and the micronoise-eliza-plugin, which enables token swaps via x402 payments. Additionally, ongoing discussions continued regarding the integration of MoltBridge as a Trust and Discovery Layer for ElizaOS. The MoltBridge integration proposal requires continued community input, particularly concerning the benefits it would provide for Eliza agents and the onboarding program for founding agents. A recent update confirmed that MoltBridge is now live and detailed its capabilities and advantages for the Eliza agent ecosystem.",
