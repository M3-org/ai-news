          "text": "Developers discussed integrating Eliza Twitter plugin with Openclaw, with users successfully implementing the Eliza Twitter plugin on Openclaw as it provides better Twitter functionality than Openclaw's native methods which could risk account bans. A user committed to sharing their fork on GitHub for others to use. Discussion also covered ElizaCloud development status, with concerns about making the platform more accessible for agents to use via CLI or API. The team is actively working on ElizaCloud which powers milaidy and other projects, with recent improvements to the cloud API and plans to update LLM integration.",

The team is working with Privy on new authentication features that may significantly change the current system. Developers explored using agent signatures for ElizaCloud signup and discussed implementing proof-of-agent systems through coding tasks, with potential 8004 registration requirements. The goal is to make API key generation easier for agents while maintaining security.",

Five potential investors tested the platform but encountered problems including welcome bonus issues, billing difficulties with VPN usage, confusion about payment methods, and challenges finding reliable plugins. The feedback highlighted confusion about the target audience (coders vs non-coders, B2B vs B2C) and missing clear project objectives. Users requested better dashboard UX, clearer payment processes, more plugins in an app-store-like interface, and consideration of labeling the service as beta during bug fixes.",
