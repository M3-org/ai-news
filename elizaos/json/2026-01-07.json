          "text": "## Technical Issues and Fixes\n\n### Discord Plugin Bootstrap Issues\nMultiple users experienced problems with the Discord plugin, particularly with version 1.7.0. The main issue involved server ID detection errors when using the bootstrap plugin. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` and created a fix branch (odi-17) with corrections for bootstrap's actions/providers. A PR (#6333) was submitted to address these issues, though it still required testing with Discord plugin version 1.3.3. Users experiencing these problems were advised to either wait for the fix or potentially downgrade to core version 1.6.5.\n\n### ElizaOS Cloud API Integration\nA user reported \"Model not found\" errors when building ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. The solution provided was to use proper model parameter formatting with provider prefixes, such as:\n- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`\n- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`\n- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`",

The updates involved refactoring to use `handleMessage` instead of the deprecated `sendMessage` method.\n\n### Hybrid Architecture RFC\nStan published RFC-001 exploring a hybrid architecture with persistent workers. The document is available for team review and feedback on HackMD. The team also has a workspace on HackMD at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book.\n\n### Discord Gateway Implementation\nOdilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch, which contains Shaw's preferred implementation of the Discord bridge. The architecture discussion touched on the need for individual event pumps for different services, with considerations for scaling and preprocessing. Voice connections were noted as requiring higher priority/bandwidth event pumps compared to text.",

          "text": "## Community and Token Discussions\n\n### Contract Address Visibility\nThere was discussion about posting the ElizaOS contract address (CA) across official X accounts. While initially the team was hesitant, Shaw confirmed they would work on making the CA more accessible. The consensus was that while putting it in the bio might seem scam-like, a pinned tweet on the Eliza account could work. The team noted that the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for easier token information access.\n\n### Token Migration Questions\nUsers had questions about the ai16z to ElizaOS token migration, with clarification provided that only tokens held at the time of the snapshot (November 11) are eligible for migration at the 1:6 ratio.\n\n### Development Tools Note\nOdilitime shared an interesting finding from a Cursor call: when users input their own Claude API key in Cursor, they don't get the Cursor-optimized version of Claude that includes output improvements.",
