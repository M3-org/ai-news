          "text": "## Discord Plugin Bootstrap Fixes\n\nOdilitime created a branch (odi-17) with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers to address issues users were experiencing with version 1.7.0. The main problem involved serverId vs messageServerId migration causing \"No server ID found\" errors when running Discord bots. A fix was submitted via PR #6333, though it still required testing with discord plugin version 1.3.3. The team discussed rushing out a release with this critical fix.\n\nUsers experiencing issues with Discord bots were advised to either wait for the fix or try using an older core version like 1.6.5. The errors were primarily related to the bootstrap plugin's handling of server IDs and user permissions.",
