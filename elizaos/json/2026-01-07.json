          "text": "## Discord Plugin Bootstrap Fixes\n\nOdilitime created a branch (odi-17) with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers to address issues users were experiencing with version 1.7.0. The main problem involved serverId vs messageServerId migration causing \"No server ID found\" errors when running Discord bots. A fix was submitted via PR #6333, though it still required testing with discord plugin version 1.3.3. The team discussed rushing out a release with this critical fix.\n\nUsers experiencing issues with Discord bots were advised to either wait for the fix or try using an older core version like 1.6.5. The errors were primarily related to the bootstrap plugin's handling of server IDs and user permissions.",

The team acknowledged this issue and committed to improving CA visibility. Shaw confirmed they would \"get on it\" regarding posting the CA across official accounts.\n\nThere was debate about whether to include the CA in Twitter bios or pinned tweets. The consensus was that pinned tweets would be more appropriate than bio placement (which could appear scam-like), and that the linktree would be refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information. The team emphasized that finding the correct CA should take no more than 10 seconds on the website or Twitter.",

The updates involved refactoring to use handleMessage instead of the deprecated sendMessage method.\n\n### Hybrid Architecture RFC\nStan prepared an RFC document exploring persistent workers and hybrid architecture for ElizaOS. The team discussed the need for individual gateways for problematic connectors, with Shaw's preferred implementation visible in the Jeju cloud branch's discord-gateway.\n\nKey architectural considerations included:\n- Simple event pumps as the direction forward\n- Multiple daemon instances per service for scale\n- Higher priority/bandwidth event pumps for voice connections vs text\n- Preprocessing to improve efficiency\n\n### Cloud Optimizations\nStan is working on cloud fixes to handle TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, along with runtime initialization optimizations.",
