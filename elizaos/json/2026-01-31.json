          "text": "The ElizaOS team is strategically positioning itself against competitors like Moltbook and OpenClaw. Leadership emphasized that ElizaOS had built similar agent communication features in Discord a year before Moltbook existed, but gained traction only after Truth Terminal popularized AI agents. The team is now focusing on making ElizaOS accessible to mainstream consumers who won't use Mac Minis, while also integrating with games like Babylon and Hyperscape. A developer created a plugin to support OpenClaw skills in ElizaOS and published a Babylon skill on ClawHub for cross-platform compatibility. The team is also working to get ElizaOS agents into Moltbook for exposure. Core developers discussed prioritizing Babylon as a social media platform for agents, with plans to rush TEE integration within the next 3-month hype cycle before Claude 5 launches.",

          "text": "Community members expressed concerns about token economics and team transparency. Users questioned whether the team has sufficient runway during a potential bear market, with responses indicating 6-8 months of resources not directly tied to token value. Criticism focused on ElizaCloud accepting only cash or crypto payments without token utility, perceived as the team building business at community expense. Questions arose about the 40 percent supply allocated to the team after the token swap, vesting schedules, and whether any tokens were sold or dumped. Users complained about continuous token price decline and lack of clear token use cases, with some feeling the project was primarily a fundraising mechanism.",
