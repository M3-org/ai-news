          "text": "## Technical Issues and Fixes\n\n### Discord Plugin Server ID Bug\nA critical bug was identified in ElizaOS version 1.7.0 where the Discord plugin couldn't detect server IDs, usernames, or server owners. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was occurring due to the transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase. Odilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) and submitted PR #6333 to address bootstrap plugin actions/providers issues. The team recommended users either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5. The fix was tested but still required compatibility work with Discord plugin version 1.3.3.",

They highlighted their experience with agent autonomy systems, DeFi interactions, and policy-gated execution layers. The engineer proposed working on:\n- Agent ↔ onchain execution layers with explicit guardrails\n- Practical agent templates for prediction markets/event-driven systems\n- Observability and accountability tooling for inspectable agent decisions\n\nOdilitime recommended starting by reading the code and working on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/, while Kenk suggested connecting for future open sessions. The team emphasized ElizaOS's plugin-based architecture as an entry point for new developers.",

The error indicated that columns would be dropped from the database. The solution provided was to either:\n1. Set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development\n2. Use `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development\n3. Delete the `.eliza` folder to reset the database (workaround)\n\nThe team clarified this is safe for local development but requires careful review for production deployments.",

Shaw confirmed they would add CAs to official accounts, and the team noted that a refreshed Linktree would point to CoinGecko. There was debate about whether top projects typically pin CAs in bios or tweets, with the consensus being that easier discoverability is needed.",
