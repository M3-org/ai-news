          "text": "## Technical Issues and Bug Fixes\n\n### Discord Plugin Server ID Issues\nA user (DigitalDiva) experienced persistent problems with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite having correct permissions and intents enabled. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3.\n\nOdilitime identified the root cause as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) with corrections for bootstrap's actions/providers. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to address these issues, though additional testing with various Discord branches was still needed.\n\n### Database Migration Errors\nUsers running `elizaos start` a second time encountered destructive migration errors. The solution provided was to either:\n- Set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development\n- Use `elizaos dev` command for continuous monitoring during development\n- Delete the `.eliza` folder as a workaround (not recommended for production)",

They were also pointed to the elizaos-plugins GitHub organization and encouraged to start by reading code and asking questions.",

Discussion emerged around whether each problematic connector would need its own gateway, with the direction pointing toward simple event pumps that can scale with multiple daemon instances per service.\n\n### Development Tools\nFrom a Cursor call, it was noted that using your own Claude API key in Cursor means you don't get the Cursor-optimized version of Claude (where they apply tricks to improve output).",
