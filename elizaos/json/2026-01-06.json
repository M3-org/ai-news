          "text": "## Technical Issues and Bug Fixes\n\n### Discord Plugin Server ID Issue\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) with corrections for bootstrap's actions/providers. A PR (#6333) was submitted to address these issues, though additional testing with various Discord branches was still needed.\n\n### Database Migration Errors\nUsers reported destructive migration errors when running `elizaos start` a second time. The solution was to either set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` or use `elizaos dev` command for continuous development monitoring instead of repeatedly using `elizaos start`.",

The discussion centered on whether to include CAs in Twitter bios or pinned tweets. Shaw acknowledged the feedback and committed to addressing it, though Kenk challenged the approach by noting that top projects don't typically put CAs in their bios. The team agreed to update the Linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier access to token information.\n\n### Token Migration Questions\nUsers had questions about the AI16Z to ElizaOS migration, with confusion about the 6:1 ratio and whether buying AI16Z after the November 11 snapshot would allow migration. The team clarified that purchases after the snapshot are not eligible for migration.\n\n### X402 Protocol Integration\nAlleyBoss shared an updated library for experimenting with x402 protocol integrated with ElizaOS: `npm i @alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`",
