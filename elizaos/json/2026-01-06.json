          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility. The team recommended users either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5 to avoid the issue.",

Odilitime welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on plugins, directing them to github.com/elizaos-plugins/ for available plugins. The lead developer of the Spartan project (a DeFi utilities component) offered to collaborate, sharing the Spartan GitHub repository. K_carv recommended connecting with jin for future open sessions.",

The team clarified that the migration snapshot date was November 11, and tokens purchased after that date are not eligible for migration.
