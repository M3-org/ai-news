          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility. The team recommended users experiencing similar issues either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5.",

Odilitime, the lead dev on Spartan, welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on existing plugins. The team pointed to the elizaos-plugins GitHub organization and recommended connecting with core developers. The contributor was directed to explore the Spartan project for DeFi utilities.",

Users noted it was too hard for most people to locate the correct CAs within 10 seconds on the website or Twitter. The team acknowledged the issue, with shaw confirming they would address it. Discussion ensued about whether to include CAs in bios or pinned tweets, with the team noting that most top projects don't follow this pattern but agreeing the current flow doesn't work well. A solution involving updating the Linktree to point to CoinGecko was mentioned as being in progress.",

Community helpers explained this is safe for local development and recommended using `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.",
