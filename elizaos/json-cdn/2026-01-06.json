          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility. The team recommended users experiencing similar issues either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5.",

Odilitime welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/. The contributor was also encouraged to connect with Kenk for potential collaboration, with plans for open sessions in the near future. The team emphasized ElizaOS's plugin-based architecture as an entry point for new developers.",

The error message indicated: \"Destructive migration blocked - set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true or use force option.\" The workaround of deleting the `.eliza` folder worked but wasn't ideal. Community helper stackweaver provided a solution: explicitly allow migrations by setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start`, noting this is safe for local development but requires careful review for production. Omid Sa also recommended using `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.",

The discussion highlighted that most users struggle to locate the correct CA within 10 seconds on the website or Twitter. Shaw acknowledged the issue and committed to addressing it, stating \"we'll get on it.\" Kenk challenged the approach by asking for examples of top 50 projects with CA in their X bio or pinned tweets, suggesting this isn't standard practice. The team indicated they're refreshing their Linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier token information access. Broccolex emphasized that while a pinned tweet might not be the solution, the current flow doesn't work for most people.",
