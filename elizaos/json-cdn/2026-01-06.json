          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility. The team recommended users experiencing similar issues either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5.",

Odilitime welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on plugins, directing them to github.com/elizaos-plugins/ for available plugins. The lead developer of the Spartan project (https://github.com/elizaos/spartan) offered to collaborate on DeFi utilities. K_carv recommended connecting with Odilitime and mentioned upcoming open sessions for contributors.",

The error indicated that columns would be dropped unless `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` was set. A community helper explained this occurs because ElizaOS detects destructive database migrations and provided the solution: explicitly allow migrations by setting the environment variable. For continuous development monitoring, the team recommended using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` to avoid repeatedly triggering migration checks.",

Users noted it was too hard for most people to find the right CAs within 10 seconds on the website or Twitter. Shaw acknowledged the feedback and committed to posting the CA more prominently. K_carv defended the current approach, noting that most top 50 projects don't have CAs in their bios and that the linktree would be refreshed to point to CoinGecko. The team discussed that pinned tweets might be a solution, though some argued it could make the project appear scam-like. Regarding migration, it was clarified that only users who held tokens at the November 11 snapshot are eligible to migrate.",

He's working on cloud fixes to handle TOCTOU race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, plus runtime initialization optimizations\n\n- **Messaging API Refactoring**: Stan submitted PRs for unified messaging API implementation in both Telegram and Discord plugins, moving from deprecated `sendMessage` to `handleMessage`\n\n- **Gateway Architecture**: Discussion around Discord bridge implementation, with Odilitime recommending review of the Jeju cloud branch (https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway) for Shaw's preferred implementation. The team discussed scaling considerations for event pumps, noting voice connections will need higher priority/bandwidth than text\n\n- **Documentation**: Jin shared the team's HackMD workspace at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book",
